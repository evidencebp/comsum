On IDBObjectStore and IDBIndex instances, the keyPath property says is
defined in the spec with: ""if this attribute returns an object
(specifically an Array), it returns the same object instance every
time it is inspected"". Web platform tests for this were missing.

Since the property is 'any' in Web IDL (since it could be a string or
Array) it can't use the [SameObject] extended attribute. And in the
Blink IDL, it can't use the [SaveSameObject] hint since that requires
[SameObject]. Instead, use the [CachedAttribute] hint and never dirty
the cache.

tprrt/linux-stable,c675e06a98a474f7ad0af32ce467613da818da52,ipvlan: decouple l3s mode dependencies from other modes,"

Right now ipvlan has a hard dependency on CONFIG_NETFILTER and
otherwise it cannot be built. However, the only ipvlan operation
mode that actually depends on netfilter is l3s, everything else
is independent of it. Break this hard dependency such that users
are able to use ipvlan l3 mode on systems where netfilter is not
compiled in.

Therefore, this adds a hidden CONFIG_IPVLAN_L3S bool which is
defaulting to y when CONFIG_NETFILTER is set in order to retain
existing behavior for l3s. All l3s related code is refactored
into ipvlan_l3s.c that is compiled in when enabled.

tprrt/linux-stable,4ce33ec2e42d4661bf05289e213bc088eecb9132,ipc/sem: optimize perform_atomic_semop(),"

This is the main workhorse that deals with semop user calls such that
the waitforzero or semval update operations, on the set, can complete on
not as the sma currently stands.  Currently, the set is iterated twice
(setting semval, then backwards for the sempid value).  Slowpaths, and
particularly SEM_UNDO calls, must undo any altered sem when it is
detected that the caller must block or has errored-out.

With larger sets, there can occur situations where this involves a lot
of cycles and can obviously be a suboptimal use of cached resources in
shared memory.  Ie, discarding CPU caches that are also calling semop
and have the sembuf cached (and can complete), while the current lock
holder doing the semop will block, error, or does a waitforzero
operation.

This patch proposes still iterating the set twice, but the first scan is
read-only, and we perform the actual updates afterward, once we know
that the call will succeed.  In order to not suffer from the overhead of
dealing with sops that act on the same sem_num, such (rare) cases use
perform_atomic_semop_slow(), which is exactly what we have now.
Duplicates are detected before grabbing sem_lock, and uses simple a
32/64-bit hash array variable to based on the sem_num we are working on.

In addition add some comments to when we expect to the caller to block.

chromium/chromium,7cfe6fc556524635d4ac71362dd968e0d0dc7659,Display precursor origins when applicable in external protocol dialog,"

External protocol dialogs display the origin that initiated the
external protocol request. The initiating origin helps the user
attribute the request to a particular site, so that they can decide if
they can trust that site to launch an external application. When the
initiating origin was opaque (such as from a sandboxed iframe), the
dialog would display no origin or a generic message, so the user
didn't have any information for making a trust decision. This CL
converts the initiating origin to its precursor origin (the origin
that created the initiating origin) when creating the external
protocol dialog. Displaying the precursor origin gives the user more
useful information for making a trust decision.

edit phone numbers.  Such accounts cannot create person records and
have no spoecial access to those for other people.  Editing will only
work if the account's country is the same as the person's country.

In this implementation, there is no friendly user interface to create
such an account; a person number needs to be entered manually on the
user edit form.  The intended way to create such accounts is through
bulk registration of people, once that is implemented.

Use HorizontalSplitOutputProducer to combine the output from the buffer tree
(i.e., the main contents) and the editor status. This has the nice advantage of
forcing us to declare where the cursor belongs, which solves a bug when the
cursor jumps back to the buffer tree (because previously we were unaware of the
""accident"" that the status had stolen it).

tprrt/linux-stable,4d3b3d5fd7d42a522a6c444388826bb23264db9f,drm/i915: fix how we mask PMIMR when adding work to the queue,"

It seems we've been doing this ever since we started processing the
RPS events on a work queue, on commit ""drm/i915: move gen6 rps
handling to workqueue"", 4912d04193733a825216b926ffd290fada88ab07.

The problem is: when we add work to the queue, instead of just masking
the bits we queued and leaving all the others on their current state,
we mask the bits we queued and unmask all the others. This basically
means we'll be unmasking a bunch of interrupts we're not going to
process. And if you look at gen6_pm_rps_work, we unmask back only
GEN6_PM_RPS_EVENTS, which means the bits we unmasked when adding work
to the queue will remain unmasked after we process the queue.

Notice that even though we unmask those unrelated interrupts, we never
enable them on IER, so they don't fire our interrupt handler, they
just stay there on IIR waiting to be cleared when something else
triggers the interrupt handler.

So this patch does what seems to make more sense: mask only the bits
we add to the queue, without unmasking anything else, and so we'll
unmask them after we process the queue.

As a side effect we also have to remove that WARN, because it is not
only making sure we don't mask useful interrupts, it is also making
sure we do unmask useless interrupts! That piece of code should not be
responsible for knowing which bits should be unmasked, so just don't
assert anything, and trust that snb_disable_pm_irq should be doing the
right thing.

With i915.enable_pc8=1 I was getting ocasional ""GEN6_PMIIR is not 0""
error messages due to the fact that we unmask those unrelated
interrupts but don't enable them.

Note: if bugs start bisecting to this patch, then it probably means
someone was relying on the fact that we unmask everything by accident,
then we should fix gen5_gt_irq_postinstall or whoever needs the
accidentally unmasked interrupts. Or maybe I was just wrong and we
need to revert this patch :)

Note: This started to be a more real issue with the addition of the
VEBOX support since now we do enable more than just the minimal set of
RPS interrupts in the IER register. Which means after the first rps
interrupt has happened we will never mask the VEBOX user interrupts
again and so will blow through cpu time needlessly when running video
workloads.

====================
this is a pull request of 10 patches for net-next/master.

It consists of three patches by Alexander Shiyan, which improve the
mcp251x driver. Stefano Babic's patch move the SPI driver into a sub
folder. The three patches by Olivier Sobrie add support for the Kvaser
Leaf v2 and usb mini PCIe hardware to the existing driver. Alexander
Stein contributes eg20t support to the c_can pci driver. Together with
the patches on the net-tree, we'll be able to remove the pch_can driver
soon. Kurt Van Dijck's two patches clean up the sysfs attributes of the
softing driver.

Commit 24587380f61d (""parisc: Add MADV_HWPOISON and MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE"") added
the necessary constants to handle hardware-poisoning. Those were needed to
support the page deallocation feature from firmware.

But I completely missed to add the relevant fault handler code. This now
showed up when I ran the madvise07 testcase from the Linux Test Project,
which failed with a kernel BUG at arch/parisc/mm/fault.c:320.

With this patch the parisc kernel now behaves like other platforms and
gives the same kernel syslog warnings when poisoning pages.

  necessary.

This enables IRQFD support for sPAPR. The feature decreases the latency
of interrupt handling.

To enable IRQFD for MSI, this sets kvm_gsi_direct_mapping to true which
enables direct MSI mapping.

To enable IRQFD for LSI (level triggered INTx interrupts), a PCI host bus
callback is required. The patch for that is coming next.

The loading address is too close to the kernel address, so newer kernels
may overlap memory space, so loading the device tree may corrupt zImage.

This patch moves the fdt_addr_r to 0x14000000 which is also consistent
with guidance that the kernel be allocated 32MB.  This places it
in the same place as the ramdisk, so this patch moves the ramdisk address
512KB after the fdt.

couchbase/ns_server,4d2b5681ad2fac1e826a756c58feaa04832627b8,[meck] Pull meck source into ns_server,"

Meck is an Apache 2.0 licensed mocking library for Erlang.
It looks to have reasonable features and to be the best of the
currently available open source Erlang mocking libraries.

Using meck will allow us to get rid of `mock` and `mock_gen_server`.
Meck includes all the module mocking capabilities of mock but
importantly also includes the ability to mock some functions but
""passthrough"" to the original module for unmocked functions.

Mock_gen_server is no longer needed - it's easy to use meck to
create a module for scratch, add an init method and start a
gen_server in a couple of lines of code. Overall this means
we have one mocking API that's necessarily consistent.

A gentle but informative introduction to meck can be found here:
http://www.erlang-factory.com/upload/presentations/422/MeckatErlangFactory,London2011.pdf

The v0.8 release notes are also worth reading:

ESC updates run in sync with actuator_control updates. UAVCAN is scheduled
at a fixed rate of 3ms (previously the poll timeout) and on each UAVCAN

This leads to roughly the same behavior as before. CPU & RAM usage are
pretty much the same (tested on Pixhawk 4).

a) teach __MAP(num, m, <list of type/name pairs>) to take empty
list (with num being 0, of course)
b) fold types__... and args__... declaration and initialization into
SYSCALL_METADATA(num, ...), making their use conditional on num != 0.
That allows to use the SYSCALL_METADATA instead of its near-duplicate
in SYSCALL_DEFINE0.
c) make SYSCALL_METADATA expand to nothing in case if CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS
is not defined; that allows to make SYSCALL_DEFINE0 and SYSCALL_DEFINEx
definitions independent from CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS.
d) kill SYSCALL_DEFINE - no users left (SYSCALL_DEFINE[0-6] is, of course,
still alive and well).

apache/spark,c6d75745de58ff1445912bf72a58b6ad2b3f863c,[SPARK-2390] Files in staging directory cannot be deleted and wastes the space of HDFS,"

When running jobs with YARN Cluster mode and using HistoryServer, the files in the Staging Directory (~/.sparkStaging on HDFS) cannot be deleted.
HistoryServer uses directory where event log is written, and the directory is represented as a instance of o.a.h.f.FileSystem created by using FileSystem.get.

On the other hand, ApplicationMaster has a instance named fs, which also created by using FileSystem.get.

FileSystem.get returns cached same instance when URI passed to the method represents same file system and the method is called by same user.
Because of the behavior, when the directory for event log is on HDFS, fs of ApplicationMaster and fileSystem of FileLogger is same instance.
When shutting down ApplicationMaster, fileSystem.close is called in FileLogger#stop, which is invoked by SparkContext#stop indirectly.

And ApplicationMaster#cleanupStagingDir also called by JVM shutdown hook. In this method, fs.delete(stagingDirPath) is invoked.
Because fs.delete in ApplicationMaster is called after fileSystem.close in FileLogger, fs.delete fails and results not deleting files in the staging directory.

I think, calling fileSystem.delete is not needed.

google/llvm-propeller,171313c69a1d6e881cb28ecd8a549675c150e920,[StatepointLowering] Change AllocatedStackSlots to use SmallBitVector,"

NFCI.  They key motivation here is that I'd like to use
SmallBitVector::all() in a later change.  Also, using a bit vector here
seemed better in general.

The only interesting change here is that in the failure case of
allocateStackSlot, we no longer (the equivalent of) push_back(true) to
AllocatedStackSlots.  As far as I can tell, this is fine, since we'd
never re-use those slots in the same StatepointLoweringState instance.

Technically there was no need to change the operator[] type accesses to
set() and test(), but I thought it'd be nice to make it obvious that
we're using something other than a std::vector like thing.

        Stylesheet href property shows redirected URL unlike other browsers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33683

        Teach StyleSheet the difference between original and final URLs in
        redirect chains.  Unfortunately, StyleSheet needs to know both of these
        URLs.  The original URL is needed for the href property and the final
        URL is needed as the baseURL.

        This change required touching a lot of lines of code because we need to
        plumb this information to the StyleSheet object.  I audited all
        existing clients of href() and setHref() to see whether they wanted the
        original or final URLs.  I then updated the clients (except the JS
        bindings themselves) to use the correct accessor.

Credit du Nord PEE has (now) an enhanced security feature,
using a kind of 'fingerprinting' of the browser device which
is used to detect if you changed device ; and will trigger
the sending of a OTP to email or SMS for authorization of
a new device.
If you fill-in the proper OTP you received, it will allow
this new device from now on.

The current creditdunordpee does not handle this feature,
and I was not able to add it easily.

Instead, I found that this bank is using what looks like a
shared platform with other banks - that is already supported
by weboob (module : s2e for the shared code, and modules:
bnppere, capeasi, erehsbc, esalia for the banks using it)

Thus I rewrote the creditdunordpee module to use s2e shared
code and have the authentication working.

In addition to fixing authentication, the use of s2e module
gives us a new capability (CapBankPockets). Morever, it seems
maintained.

Return an error if the user tried to check or set the fan
parameters while the card is powered down (e.g., on a PX/HG
system for example).  This makes the fan consistent with the
temperature stuff.

Since the assumption is usually that bold text is drawn in bright
colors, this might break some applications. However some other terminals
have already taken this leap, which should lessen the impact for
Alacritty.

Since this might still be desired and necessary for certain
applications, the config option is just switched to draw with normal
colors by default, however the old behavior can still be restored.

This patch adds IPv6 support for RFC5082 Generalized TTL Security Mechanism.  

Not to users of mapped address; the IPV6 and IPV4 socket options are seperate.
The server does have to deal with both IPv4 and IPv6 socket options
and the client has to handle the different for each family.

On client:
	int ttl = 255;
	getaddrinfo(argv[1], argv[2], &hint, &result);

	for (rp = result; rp != NULL; rp = rp->ai_next) {
		s = socket(rp->ai_family, rp->ai_socktype, rp->ai_protocol);
		if (s < 0) continue;

		if (rp->ai_family == AF_INET) {
			setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_TTL, &ttl, sizeof(ttl));
		} else if (rp->ai_family == AF_INET6) {
			setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IPV6,  IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS, 
					&ttl, sizeof(ttl)))
		}
			
		if (connect(s, rp->ai_addr, rp->ai_addrlen) == 0) {
		   ...

On server:
	int minttl = 255 - maxhops;
   
	getaddrinfo(NULL, port, &hints, &result);
	for (rp = result; rp != NULL; rp = rp->ai_next) {
		s = socket(rp->ai_family, rp->ai_socktype, rp->ai_protocol);
		if (s < 0) continue;

		if (rp->ai_family == AF_INET6)
			setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IPV6,  IPV6_MINHOPCOUNT,
					&minttl, sizeof(minttl));
		setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MINTTL, &minttl, sizeof(minttl));

kythe/kythe,dfb3fdd92d2d176f8f5d9498329ae3b5a81243dd,Reproduce header search state and use a VFS for (k)index( packs).,"

Summary:
This CL addresses file lookup from index packs in a more thorough
way. Previously we used Clang tooling support for virtual files
and attempted to canonicalze paths using the working directory
at the time of extraction. This was not a complete solution, as
some paths with relative elements (foo/../bar) would not be
correctly handled. In fact, one root cause of T24 was that
relative paths were not mapped to virtual files, but instead were
looked up in the real filesystem. By using a virtual filesystem,
we can prevent (most) access to the real filesystem, thus catching
these kinds of errors in the future.

The other root cause of T24 is that the extractor can set up
a header search state that is not reproduced in the indexer.
Absent any manipulation, the header search state is a function
of the machine on which Clang is currently running. This leads to
confusion when the indexer is run on a machine distinct from the one
that ran the extractor. Unfortunately, Clang's representation of
the search state depends on objects (DirectoryEntry*s) that cannot
be reasonably constructed without control of the VFS layer.

This CL does make the assumption that paths are tree-structured
(/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.9/../../../../include/c++/4.9/string
is the same as /usr/include/c++/4.9/string). Should this be a problem,
we can complicate path canonicalization, perhaps by checking in the
extractor whether relative paths have this property or not and
blacklisting the ones that fail.

Tests were changed minimally. When not reading from a kindex
or index pack, the indexer will still access the local filesystem.

This is a continuation of the inadvertently-closed D64.

This addresses T24.

Even though the parameter is called `heads`, it's not necessarily heads.
It can be:

2) Hex-encoded list of heads
3) hex encoded word ""hashed"" and a hash of heads' hashes.

Proof: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/file/tip/mercurial/wireproto.py#l362

Previously we just parsed list of hashes, and it wasn't correct. This diff fixes it

This fixes the tests because the FixtureDataTestBase doesn't reset
sequences – in this case, _uid_seq ran higher and higher across
tests.v, eventually reaching above 1024, which caused the collision
with the dataset setting an explicit uid.

Anyhow, testing that setting an explicit uid is possible is just no
use case and should not be done except for special purposes, such as
the initial importer.  On these occasions, one should fix the
sequences when finished – as is done in the legacy importer.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
The current internal `table()` API of `SparkSession` bypasses the Analyzer and directly calls `sessionState.catalog.lookupRelation` API. This skips the view resolution logics in our Analyzer rule `ResolveRelations`. This internal API is widely used by various DDL commands, public and internal APIs.

Users might get the strange error caused by view resolution when the default database is different.
```
Table or view not found: t1; line 1 pos 14
org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Table or view not found: t1; line 1 pos 14
	at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis(package.scala:42)
```

This PR is to fix it by enforcing it to use `ResolveRelations` to resolve the table.

## How was this patch tested?
Added a test case and modified the existing test cases

This was one of the few ensugarings when I hesitated wrt their placement.

On the one hand, representing `B(2)` in `class C extends B(2)` as an Apply
is syntactically natural, even if a bit awkward.

On the other hand, applications of types to terms are particularly incompatible
with scalac's infrastructure (e.g. app.symbol is a type symbol, not a superctor symbol),
and that bit me when I implemented name/default desugaring for supercalls.
Therefore, I'm reverting the original decision to have supercall processed
in ensugar and moving it to host.

libra/libra,7eac36c9c8c326282732981d0f280b8f38e89d5c,[Consensus] Fix process_votes_basic_test,"

Our process_votes_basic_test was a bit of a fake :)
It was looking for new round event for round 1, which is event that generated when pacemaker is initialized. (not related to vote, as the test name suggests).

Vote produces event for round 2, but we normally was just ignoring this event, since event from initialization would make test pass.

However, pacemaker was recently refactored to have part of initialization concurrent, as a result we sometimes had races, when event from vote process would appear before event from initialization, causing test to fail.

This fixes test by first waiting on initialization event before processing vote.

Bigger question is that our pacemaker seem to be a bit racy, but we can think of solution separately.

facebook/flow,61cd0d4e66f082ae03a13d01c0c853d0a72cccff,force-recheck command,"

Summary:Sometimes dfind takes a while to notify that a file has changed, so when status
is called immediately after a file is changed, it is possible to get stale
results.

To solve this problem, this diff implements a command that forces recheck of a file.
Now, when force_recheck && status is called immediately after a file is changed, there are two scenarios:

* either dfind wins, in which an extra recheck is forced but this is cheap
  because we don't do much if the file hasn't changed

* or dfind loses, in which case a recheck is forced, then dfind causes an extra
  recheck, but again this is cheap because we don't do much if the file hasn't
  changed.

Thus the overhead of using this command is roughly the parsing time of a file,
which is not much.

Technically, implementing the command needs some refactoring of how client commands
are processed by the server, so that recheck can be called as part of such
processing. In particular, client commands now take and give back server
envs. This generalization also subsumes the implementation of status
--wait-for-recheck, which is thus deleted.

google/llvm-propeller,1eab30dc174afcf9fae35acd3125c7512ca8a1ea,docs: Nuke the old release notes.,"

This change also removes a bunch of boilerplate and stuffing which made
it unnecessarily hard to navigate and see the comparatively miniscule
actual content that was added to this document during the 3.2
development period (or maybe even sticking around from earlier
releases...).

The new organization (a flat list) optimizes for making it easy for
people who know about changes to add them to the document.  It's
completely trivial for anyone with basic knowledge of LLVM to come in
later (such as when preparing for the actual release) and cluster any
changes into logical groups. However, I have left some comments
indicating how to add larger descriptions, if someone is feeling
adventurous ;)

Hopefully this organization will highlight how little effort is being
put into producing accurate, high-quality release notes, prompting a
corresponding improvement for the 3.3 release.

I have preserved the changes to this document that are not present
in the 3.2 release notes. There were only two... I'm pretty sure we've
been busier than that... (version control shows +213347/-173656 raw
lines just in the LLVM repo since the 3.2 release).

  This patch will work with the 19HS but WILL BREAK all other Keyspan
  adapters.  It will take me a few days to get to looking at a correct fix but
  that keyspan_send_setup(port, 1) (and the '1' is the important part) must

  whatever the normal default is for your serial environment.

So revert this again pending the proper fix.

This patch addresses the following compilation errors with gcc 4.7 and

itkNumericTraits.cxx:75:38: error: 'constexpr' needed for in-class
initialization of static data member 'const float
itk::NumericTraits<float>::One' of non-integral type [-fpermissive]

It has been tested with Apple Clang 7.0.2, GCC 4.9, GCC 5.1 all with
C++11. Without C++11 the code should remain the same.

Instead of using #ifdefs let's mark suspend and resume methods as
__maybe_unused which will suppress compiler warnings about them being
unused and provide better compile coverage.

Because SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() produces an empty omap_rng_pm structure in
case of !CONFIG_PM_SLEEP neither omap_rng_suspend nor omap_rng_resume
will end up being referenced and the change will not result in
increasing image size.

google/llvm-propeller,b4278895a40ba4adc59d91c9a40537076183941b,"Revert r323281 ""Adjust MaxAtomicInlineWidth for i386/i486 targets.""","

As reported on http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2018-August/058760.html,
this broke i386-freebsd11 due to its lack of atomic 64 bit primitives.

While that's not really this commit's fault, let's revert back to the old
behaviour until this can be fixed. This means generating cmpxchg8b etc for i386
and i486 which don't technically support those, but that's been the behaviour
for a long time, so a little longer probably doesn't hurt that much.

> Adjust MaxAtomicInlineWidth for i386/i486 targets.
>
> This is to fix the bug reported in https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34347#c6.
> Currently, all  MaxAtomicInlineWidth of x86-32 targets are set to 64. However,
> i386 doesn't support any cmpxchg related instructions. i486 only supports cmpxchg.
> So in this patch MaxAtomicInlineWidth is reset as follows:
> For i386, the MaxAtomicInlineWidth should be 0 because no cmpxchg is supported.
> For i486, the MaxAtomicInlineWidth should be 32 because it supports cmpxchg.
> For others 32 bits x86 cpu, the MaxAtomicInlineWidth should be 64 because of cmpxchg8b.

facebookexperimental/eden,4865b28d1a2a866f58a0abd997027b31c81a1ff6,localrepo: make journal.dirstate contain in-memory changes before transaction,"

Before this patch, in-memory dirstate changes aren't written out at
opening transaction, even though 'journal.dirstate' is created
directly from '.hg/dirstate'.

Therefore, subsequent 'hg rollback' uses incomplete 'undo.dirstate' to
restore dirstate, if dirstate is changed and isn't written out before
opening transaction.

In cases below, the condition ""dirstate is changed and isn't written
out before opening transaction"" isn't satisfied and this problem
doesn't appear:

  - ""wlock scope"" and ""transaction scope"" are almost equivalent

    e.g. 'commit --amend', 'import' and so on

  - dirstate changes are written out before opening transaction

    e.g. 'rebase' (via 'dirstateguard') and 'commit -A' (by separated
    wlock scopes)

On the other hand, 'backout' may satisfy the condition above.

To make 'journal.dirstate' contain in-memory changes before opening
transaction, this patch explicitly invokes 'dirstate.write()' in
'localrepository.transaction()'.

'dirstate.write()' is placed before not ""writing journal files out""
but ""invoking pretxnopen hooks"" for visibility of dirstate changes to
external hook processes.

BTW, in the test script, 'touch -t 200001010000' and 'hg status' are
invoked to make file 'c' surely clean in dirstate, because ""clean but
unsure"" files indirectly cause 'dirstate.write()' at 'repo.status()'
in 'repo.commit()' (see e1d123a2ee1f for detail) and prevents from
certainly reproducing the issue.

dart-lang/sdk,7aae1f603251eb549eb3a2107b3823d98293e84d,[vm] Relax AssertSubtype to allow non-constant sub and super types.,"

Previously, AssertSubtype instructions could only be created with a
compile-time AbstractType value for sub_type and super_type. Relax this
so that AssertSubtype instructions can be created with possibly
non-constant Values instead.

Currently, all AssertSubtype uses still have constant sub- and
supertypes, so for now we check at code generation that we indeed
have constants for these values and only handle the constant case. Thus,
there should be no impact on size or speed of the generated code from
these changes. Follow-up work will add code generation for non-constant
sub- and supertypes and add uses the generalized form.

Subsurface-divelog/subsurface,fa82ba60798be8b5e20277527053199916888b16,Moved the plot from the cairo version to the Qt version,"

Started working on the Qt version of the Plot, initially
nothing is printed - but this is not a bad thing,
the program doesn't explodes too. :)

some work had to be done about the 'bool/gboolean' stuff
so I removed all gbooleans in the code that I'v encountered.

A new file was created ( profile.h ) so I could put the
signatures of helper methods that cairo used to call.

till now the code computes the max limits.
Next patch the first drawing will be made.

tprrt/linux-stable,9d66586f7723b73c5925c7c7819c260484627851,shm: fix the filename of hugetlb sysv shared memory,"

Some user space tools need to identify SYSV shared memory when examining
/proc/<pid>/maps.  To do so they look for a block device with major zero, a
dentry named SYSV<sysv key>, and having the minor of the internal sysv
shared memory kernel mount.

To help these tools and to make it easier for people just browsing
/proc/<pid>/maps this patch modifies hugetlb sysv shared memory to use the
SYSV<key> dentry naming convention.

User space tools will still have to be aware that hugetlb sysv shared
memory lives on a different internal kernel mount and so has a different
block device minor number from the rest of sysv shared memory.

As buf is passed as a signed char buffer in fwrite_hex, fprintf will
print every byte from 0x80 as a signed-extended int causing each of
these bytes to be printed as ""\xffffff80"" and such, which can be pretty
confusing. Force fprintf to use the argument as a char to make it print
only 2 digits, e.g. ""\x80"".

revive IndexBasedArrayIteratorTest.kt soon and run the Kotlin tests in parallel
to the Java tests.

A new tab on the ride analysis view for analysing ride data in three
dimensions. Interval selection is supported and a z-axis slider is
available for helping to identify data in the z-plane. A color legend
is displayed since coloring is independent of x/y/z values.

Coloring and Z axis values are averages for associated values of x/y.
The code requires qwtplot3d to be installed (see gcconfig.pri.in) and
with older Mac dev envs you will need to add -lz to LIBS too. (LIBS += -lz).

On Linux qwt3d_function.h needs a #include <stdio.h> added to compile.

Greg Steele helped design and test.

There are 2 open issues x/y/z axis labels occasionally appear in the
wrong place. lastly, the bin selection is for X&Y bin sizes and it
would be better to have separate sliders.

Rewrite the compilation of form fields in embedded task forms to
allow extensibility of form-field annotated form elements:

- All validation attributes such as ng-pattern, required, etc. get
  properly added to the resulting form input. This allows custom
  validation and pattern matching to take place.

- Outer form is exposed as `variablesForm` to the current scope.

- Validation state may be queried via
  variablesForm.{inputName}.($valid|$invalid), i.e. the following
  markup in an embedded form will show a validation error to the
  user unless `test` is put in:

  <input form-field type=""string""
         required ng-pattern=""/^test$/"" name=""testForm"" />

  <p ng-if=""variablesForm.testForm.$invalid"">
    Need to type in <em>demo</em>.
  </p>

- Form submits only if validation state is $valid

When the runtime_suspend callback is running, 'runtime_status'
is always RPM_SUSPENDING, so pm_runtime_suspended() will always
fail.
Similarly while the runtime_resume callback is running
'runtime_status' is RPM_RESUMING, so pm_runtime_active() will
always fail.

So remove these two pointless tests.

adding a tab from a group, and removing tabs from a group by setting

Add a check to exit tab closing mode only when we are adding a tab to a

With a shared policy in place, when one of the CPUs in the policy is
hotplugged out and then brought back online, sugov_stop() and
sugov_start() are called in order.

sugov_stop() removes utilization hooks for each CPU in the policy and
does nothing else in the for_each_cpu() loop. sugov_start() on the
other hand iterates through the CPUs in the policy and re-initializes
the per-cpu structure _and_ adds the utilization hook.  This implies
that the scheduler is allowed to invoke a CPU's utilization update
hook when the rest of the per-cpu structures have yet to be
re-inited.

Apart from some strange values in tracepoints this doesn't cause a
problem, but if we do end up accessing a pointer from the per-cpu
sugov_cpu structure somewhere in the sugov_update_shared() path,
we will likely see crashes since the memset for another CPU in the
policy is free to race with sugov_update_shared from the CPU that is
ready to go.  So let's fix this now to first init all per-cpu
structures, and then add the per-cpu utilization update hooks all at
once.

A (new?) feature of TG widgets is that callable param values will be
called before the widget is rendered. Unfortunately widgets themselves
are callable, so having a widget as a parameter to another widget causes
breakage when TG tries to call the sub-widget at the wrong time.

The fix is to make the widgets be member_widgets, not params (or else
just to stuff them into the params dict in the update_params method,
rather than setting them in the constructor).

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The diameter-2.2.2 application can be applied independently of other
 applications on a full OTP 22 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-16457    Application(s): diameter

               The possibility of choosing a handler process for an
               incoming Diameter request with a configured MFA was
               documented in OTP 20.0, but counters (with
               {traffic_counters, true}) were not incremented when
               this process was on a remote node. Counters are now
               incremented on the node that configures the transport
               in question.

               Introduced in OTP 21.3.

  OTP-16459    Application(s): diameter

               Transport options differing from those passed to
               diameter:add_transport/2 were used in several
               situations: when starting a transport process after
               connect_timer expiry after an initial connection
               attempt has failed, when starting a transport process
               after a connection has been accepted, when sending
               events, when returning options in
               diameter:service_info/2, and possibly more. In
               particular, the following configuration options to
               diameter:add_transport/2 were dropped:
               avp_dictionaries, incoming_maxlen, spawn_opt,
               strict_mbit.

               Moreover, any service options mistakenly passed to
               diameter:add_transport/2 were interpreted as such,
               instead of being ignored as the documentation states,
               with the consequence that outgoing and incoming
               requests saw different values of some options, some
               were always taken from transport options, and others
               from service options.

               diameter:add_transport/2 must be called in new code for
               the fix to have effect.

               Introduced in OTP 20.1.

Rather than making the caller to pass in the median time source on
ProcessBlock and IsCurrent, modify the Config struct to include the
median time source and associate it with the chain instance when it is
created.

This is being done because both the ProcessBlock and IsCurrent functions
require access to the blockchain state already, it is a little bit safer
to ensure the time source matches the chain instance state, it
simplifies the caller logic, and it also allows its use within the logic
of the blockchain package itself which will be required by upcoming
rule change warning logic that is part of BIP9.

- For each statement in the sublist, visit with the set of statements after it:
    - If the statement is a label, recursively visit the body with the same set of following statements
    - If the statement is a using declaration, recursively visit the following statements and use those as the body of the using
    - Other statements are visited as normal
- If we saw a using during the statement visit, we've finished lowering. If not, continue down the list

* Disallow goto's across using declarations as per LDM decisions:
- Note the using variables in a block, and currently in scope
- When visiting a goto, check the location of the branch and error if it crosses illegally
- Add an extra error to distinguish between forward and backward goto errors
- Add tests

tprrt/linux-stable,590a0088825016ca7ec53f1aef7e84e1211778d8,bpf: libbpf: Add STRUCT_OPS support,"

This patch adds BPF STRUCT_OPS support to libbpf.

The only sec_name convention is SEC("".struct_ops"") to identify the
struct_ops implemented in BPF,
e.g. To implement a tcp_congestion_ops:

SEC("".struct_ops"")
struct tcp_congestion_ops dctcp = {
	.init           = (void *)dctcp_init,  /* <-- a bpf_prog */
	/* ... some more func prts ... */
	.name           = ""bpf_dctcp"",
};

Each struct_ops is defined as a global variable under SEC("".struct_ops"")
as above.  libbpf creates a map for each variable and the variable name
is the map's name.  Multiple struct_ops is supported under
SEC("".struct_ops"").

In the bpf_object__open phase, libbpf will look for the SEC("".struct_ops"")
section and find out what is the btf-type the struct_ops is
implementing.  Note that the btf-type here is referring to
a type in the bpf_prog.o's btf.  A ""struct bpf_map"" is added
by bpf_object__add_map() as other maps do.  It will then
collect (through SHT_REL) where are the bpf progs that the
func ptrs are referring to.  No btf_vmlinux is needed in
the open phase.

In the bpf_object__load phase, the map-fields, which depend
on the btf_vmlinux, are initialized (in bpf_map__init_kern_struct_ops()).
It will also set the prog->type, prog->attach_btf_id, and
prog->expected_attach_type.  Thus, the prog's properties do
not rely on its section name.
[ Currently, the bpf_prog's btf-type ==> btf_vmlinux's btf-type matching
  process is as simple as: member-name match + btf-kind match + size match.
  If these matching conditions fail, libbpf will reject.
  The current targeting support is ""struct tcp_congestion_ops"" which
  most of its members are function pointers.
  The member ordering of the bpf_prog's btf-type can be different from
  the btf_vmlinux's btf-type. ]

Then, all obj->maps are created as usual (in bpf_object__create_maps()).

Once the maps are created and prog's properties are all set,
the libbpf will proceed to load all the progs.

bpf_map__attach_struct_ops() is added to register a struct_ops
map to a kernel subsystem.

Summary:
This patch makes the splits emitted for the beginning of comment lines during
reformatting absolute. Previously, they were relative to the start of the
non-whitespace content of the line, which messes up further TailOffset
calculations in breakProtrudingToken. This fixes an assertion failure reported
in bug 34236: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34236.

zeux/meshoptimizer,39c49b3b4aca0bf288c81aaed19c50ee4ee6a06c,indexcodec: Switch from next-delta to last-delta encoding,"

It appears that encoding deltas from next, while generally efficient,
runs into issues for some meshes where the index traversal sequence
after vcache and vfetch optimization leaves a large group of triangles
around (passing them along one edge sequence) for a later traversal,
then traverses something else and then comes back. When it does, we get
an index sequence that requires a set of indices that aren't encodable
using extremely short encoding, so we fall back to next-delta, but these
deltas are large!

It's still the case that the indices are close to each other, they are
just far away from next, so encoding deltas between indices results in
more efficient index sequences.

This change thus switches to zigzag-encoded deltas from last explicitly
encoded index. In all tested meshes this is either neutral on both
pre-zstd and post-zstd sizes, or noticeably increases the compressed
sizes by sometimes encoding fewer bytes, and frequently encoding more
predictable bytes (when last-deltas are very small and next-deltas fit
in a byte but use more unique values).

An issue for some meshes is that for sequences that are generally
efficient to encode using next-delta, switching to a distant index and
switching back only requires to encode one large value (the outlier
itself), whereas for last-delta we get two large deltas - one positive
and one negative. This in general penalizes the last-delta but not
enough for it to lose to next-delta.

It's possible to use a hybrid encoding where we use either next-delta or
last-delta based on what's more efficient; this usually results in a win
compared to last-delta but the code gets more complex, so this change
avoids this for now.

This change has the following improvements in terms of bits/triangle:

buddha.obj: 10.24 -> 9.92 (pre-zstd), 6.81 -> 6.33 (post-zstd)
armadillo.obj: 10.68 -> 10.11 (pre-zstd), 4.05 -> 3.01 (post-zstd)
kitten.obj: 10.44 -> 10.09 (pre-zstd), 6.22 -> 5.51 (post-zstd)

In most cases the gains are small, up to a few %, but for large complex
meshes this can save up to 5% pre-zstd and up to 25% post-zstd.

dotnet/roslyn-analyzers,758072c99ef8f002041461b0df9ce1b0f4162f04,Turn off built-in .NET SDK analyzers if user installs analyzer NuGet package,"

Starting .NET5, we insert the analyzer assemblies with all the CA analyzers from Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers NuGet package. These analyzers are enabled by default for net5 projects or can be enabled for any .NET project by setting MSBuild property ""EnableNETAnalyzers"". However, this leads to duplicate analyzers if users explicitly install FxCopAnalyzers NuGet package or Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers NuGet package. This PR drops in additional props file in the above NuGet packages that will explicitly set ""EnableNETAnalyzers = false"". This additional props file should only be present in the NuGet packages, and not inserted into the .NET SDK, to get the correct de-dupe behavior without affecting defaults.

**Testing:**
1. Created a .net5 project using latest .NET SDK with a NuGet package reference to FxCop analyzers `3.3.0-beta2.final`:

```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net5</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include=""Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers"" Version=""3.3.0-beta2.final"">
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>
```

2. Verified duplicate CA diagnostics and analyzer assemblies in Analyzers node

3. Upgraded the project to `3.3.0-dev` package with packages built locally from this branch

4. Verified the built-in .NET SDK analyzers are disabled and no duplicate CA diagnostics or analyzer assemblies in Analyzers node.

5. Repeated the same exercise as above 4 steps with Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers instead of Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers and confirmed the same duplicates on beta2 analyzer packages, and fixes with locally built packages

hyperledger/fabric,2ccbb530b91245fe970afd4b30003387c6fc3081,[FAB-3643] respect peer.gossip.endpoint configuration,"

This patch re-adds processing that optionally assigns
peer.gossip.endpoint to our internal endpoint representation.

Without this, enabling TLS is difficult because we cannot
control the endpoint representation at runtime in a deterministic
manner.  The end result is that x509 CN/SAN validation is
likely to fail and thus our endpoint is unreachable.

Fixes FAB-3643

Now that we have multiple workers running by default
in various projects (nova/cinder/glance/trove), the
postgresql job is failing intermittently with connection
failures to the database.

The default max_connections for postgresql is 100 so here
we double that.

Note that the default max_connections for mysql used to
be 100 but is now 151, so this change brings the postgresql
configuration more in line with mysql.

Track generated header files which aren't already in genhdr-y, alongside
generic-y wrappers in the */include/generated/[uapi/]asm/ directories.
Currently only x86 generates extra headers in these directories, for the
purposes of enumerating system calls for different ABIs, and xen
hypercalls.

This will allow the asm-generic wrapper handling code to remove stale
wrappers when files are removed from generic-y, without also removing
these headers which are generated separately.

The root cause is that the address_space structure for the file
doesn't define a 'host' member.

When cxl allocates a file descriptor, it's using the anonymous inode
to back the file, but allocates a private address_space for each
context. The private address_space allows to track memory allocation
for each context. cxl doesn't define the 'host' member of the address
space, i.e. the inode. We don't want to define it as the anonymous
inode, since there's no longer a 1-to-1 relation between address_space
and inode.

To fix it, instead of using the anonymous inode, we introduce a simple
pseudo filesystem so that cxl can allocate its own inodes. So we now
have one inode for each file and address_space. The pseudo filesystem
is only mounted on the first allocation of a file descriptor by
cxl_get_fd().

Tested with cxlflash.

In PR #435, I made `SDL_Surface` a DST. This is actually invalid
because the resulting pointer `*mut SDL_Surface` became a fat pointer
(i.e. 16 bytes instead of 8 on 64-bit targets).
Unsized types (as opposed to dynamically sized types) in Rust aren't
currently possible.

To prevent partial swapping and memory corruption with
`std::mem::swap()`, the structure is 0 bytes.
This shouldn't cause any problems, as `SurfaceRef` is always a
reference to SDL-owned memory.

The SNI parser is complete, but right now the hook only retrieves the

If we have target:
cc_binary(

Now we can build a dll using bazel build //foo:bar.dll

If the target name is still bar.so, the wrapper script also
build the dll by copying the output file to bar.dll.

As part of MB-4114 we need to change the file format for
the user database shared between ns_server and memcached. We
do need the plain text password in order to support CRAM-MD5.

This patch use the new file format if the environment
variable CBSASL_PWFILE is set. If not set it will try to load
the ""old"" password format from ISASL_PWFILE.

The ""plain"" field in the password file is to be removed
when we stop supporting CRAM-MD5 (ns_server may stop populating
it at any time and we should be able to use the more secure
versions (SCRAM-SHA) automatically. The current implementation
does not try to use the hashed password for PLAIN auth if there
is no plain password).

nwjs/chromium.src,0a3ecc6715b7ad1c10bc6b4384d0bad5c8e0d165,[LayoutNG] Support objects that are opaque to whitespace collapsing,"

This patch changes following objects opaque to whitespace collapsing;
i.e., spaces before such objects and after can collapse.
- Out-of-flow objects (floats, absolute positioned objects.)
- Open/close tags.
- Bidi controls.

The ability (AppendAsOpaqueToSpaceCollapsing) originally existed and
used for bidi controls, but removed in [1] due to lack of spec and
tests. Above cases were tested in 4 browsers and re-implemented to be
interoperable.

This patch also stops injecting Object Replacement Character for OOF
objects. This is not specified, and was not possible before, but
0-length item was supported for open/close tags, and this behavior is
interopeable with Blink/Edge/WebKit.

closely coupled, hence removing the two of them at the same time. Note
that this removes a good chunk of functionality from cells v1 which turn

weechat/weechat,cac45aab469510bff21fef10cdd1a71b137c1a56,guile: fix printing of output to buffer (issue #1098),"

The support for Guile 2.2 did not implement the custom port correctly,
and did not configure it to be the default output port. This caused
output from Guile to be printed straight to the TTY, breaking the
WeeChat interface.

Note that the port is unbuffered, so that code like

    (display ""test"")

immediately results in output, without an explicit call to force-output.

SiS630 chipset enable is equal to sis540 plus superio ""poking"".

Superio poking equals IT8705F flash write enable, which is currently
dealt with on a board by board basis in board_enable.c. Not all
630 and newer based boards come with it8705/sis950 superios.

fluks/mupdf-x11-bookmarks,e3f2b26ab2e1fd0efd93497676663e184471378e,Avoid using .incbin when compiling for Android.,"

The clang 3.8 used in Android NDK r13 supports .incbin, but doesn't
take any -I arguments into account when looking for the file to be
included. In Android we depend on -I to locate the font files to be
included. For ARM-based targets this works becased Android NDK
supplies -fno-integrated-as to cause the compiler to use an external
assembler that searches the -I arguments to locate the file to
include. For x86-based targets -fno-integrated-as is not supplied
so the files cannot be located and thus the compilation fails.

To avoid this problem and be as robust as possible let's disable the
.incbin directive for Android for all architectures and compilers.

Previously users would see the same message whether their card was about
to expire or was already expired. This patch adds a new message to
handle cards which are about to expire, following the
NotifyBorrowerDeparture system preference.

TEST PLAN :

The best way to test would to have at the same time :
- a SQL client to change the expiry date of a borrower
- an OPAC session opened for the same patron.

Case 1: expiry date is set in the future
-> no warning

Case 2: expiry date is set in the near future (within the
""NotifyBorrowerDeparture"" system preference range)
-> a warning says the card will expire on **date**

Case 3: expiry date is set in the past
-> before patch, same warning as Case 2
-> after patch, new warning indicating that the card has expired

material-components/material-components-android,1a17221ee3baa0afca9d80a2da16fd1d652c28a7,Fix accessibility focus on the back layer and the content layer.,"

Problem 1. The back layer contains all views for an expanded experience, even
if they are hidden behind the content layer, this makes them accessible through
Talkback when the back layer is collapsed when all views outside of
CollapsedBackLayerContents must be for all intents and purposes disabled. They
still need to remain visible to accomodate for semi transparent views, so
changing their visibility to GONE is not an option.

Solution: Add ChildViewAccessibilityHelper that keeps track of the
importantForAccessibility property for subviews of the BackLayer and overrides
them to IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_NO_HIDE_DESCENDENTS when collapsed and then
reverts them to their original values when the back layer is expanded.

- Caveat: This new object has to implement ViewGroup.OnHierarchyChangeListener
so it can remove mappings for removed views, this way guaranteeing there is no
memory leak. This also means users of BackLayerLayout MUST NOT set their own
OnHierarchyChangeListener.

- Caveat 2: this new object does not modify any CollapsedBackLayerContents,
since views in that subview must still be accessible when collapsed.

Problem 2. When the backlayer expands, the content layer remains active through
accessibility services, we want to completely disable it. Furthermore a content
description needs to be set on the content layer view that may not match what
it already has.

Solution: Add ContentViewAccessibilityPropertiesHelper that overrides the
content layer's contentDescription, importantForAccessibility and focusable
properties (and reverts them once the back layer is collapsed), and reuses the
ChildViewAccessibilityHelper to make its child views not focusable.

Tested: Sadly this is too hard to test on Espresso, I tested this manually, I'm
trying to find a way to test them automatically.

The problem is that when using the rename for multiple files, we initially

is now blank and waiting for a possible use of the automatic option.

Add a GtkReaveler that contains a child represented by a GtkBox. The GtkBox
contains a label and the toggle button for choosing an option of automatic
renaming. The child is revealed only when necesarry, more specifically when

client only knows the characteristic UUID and does not know the handle
of the characteristic.

Split off the VT sub clock tree calculation from the rest, into its own
function. Also call the op_pll_fr argument pll_fr, since soon these may
not be OP tree values.

This paves way for additional features in the future such as dual PLL
support.

google/llvm-propeller,8d271442514409323d899908553c290d1c3faba4,[DAGCombiner] narrow truncated binops,"

The motivating case for this is shown in:
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32023
and the corresponding rot16.ll regression tests.

Because x86 scalar shift amounts are i8 values, we can end up with trunc-binop-trunc 
sequences that don't get folded in IR.

As the TODO comments suggest, there will be regressions if we extend this (for x86, 
we mostly seem to be missing LEA opportunities, but there are likely vector folds 
missing too). I think those should be considered existing bugs because this is the 
same transform that we do as an IR canonicalization in instcombine. We just need 
more tests to make those visible independent of this patch.

There have been reported regressions of the SIL 680 driver when using MMIO, so
this makes it only try MMIO on Cell blades where it's known to be necessary
(the host bridge doesn't do PIO on these).

We'll try to find the root problem with MMIO separately.

std::string. Passing a temporary string when creating a diagnostic,
and then holding on to the InFlightDiagnostic, means that the
StringRef will maintain a reference to a destroyed temporary string.

Dodge the issue locally by moving the string out to its own variable
with a longer lifetime, because only this diagnostic seems to
be affected. We should fix this architecturally later.

Maven will upload *any* classified artifact after uploading
maven-metadata.xml. We use maven-metadata.xml as a trigger to know when
to finalize the deploy, moving the contents to the actual repo and to
cloudfiles. Before this change, we essentially ignored any files that
came in after the finalization. Now, any files that come in after
finalization go straight to the actual repo and to cloudfiles.

This means that deployments with classified artifacts is no longer
atomic - the primary artifact, pom, and maven-metadata.xml will be
consistent, but any classified artifacts won't be part of that atomic
unit.

This commit also switches us from clj-http-lite to clj-http for
testing, since we need cookie support to properly test this change,
since we need to control the order of deployment, so can't use aether.

home_offsets (set with M206) are the theta offsets for the homing angle.

When a rotary delta homes it uses the angle given in the alpha_max+home_offset[0] and uses the FK
(actuator_to_cartesian) to input the angles and get the cartesian XYZ for those angles, (added a
new call Robot::reset_actuator_position(a, b, c) where a b c are the theta angles for each actuator).

M306 and trim (M666) is disabled for rotary delta. (unless someone can explain to me how trim would

disables write which waits for compaction, and compaction in turn
waits for dirty memory[1] that would be released by memtable write.

Summary:
`import {bar as baz} from ...`

Before this pointed to the entire `bar as baz` range. Now it's confined to `bar`
-- which is the actual location of the identifier acting as the member access.

This leads to some minor changes in get-def behavior. Now, get-def on the `as`
or `baz` in the above example points to the beginning of the module (same as
anywhere within the `import` statement). get-def on the `bar` still jumps to the
actual location where `bar` is exported. Jumping through the import still works
as expected.

It's incorrect to try and use -[NSApplication run] to run nested runloops as it is not possible to
interrupt a nested invocation of -run without also causing outer invocations to exit after processing
their next event. We can avoid this issue by using -[NSApplication run] for the outermost invocation
of the main runloop, while using CFRunLoopRun for any nested invocations.

Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

* Platform/RunLoop.h:
* Platform/mac/RunLoopMac.mm:
(RunLoop::RunLoop): Initialize the nesting level to 0.
(RunLoop::run): Bump the nesting level, and only use -[NSApplication run] for the outermost invocation of the
runloop. We also switch from -[NSRunloop run] to CFRunLoopRun as the former will only exit when it has no sources
left to process, while CFRunLoopRun will return immediately after CFRunLoopStop is called on it.
(RunLoop::stop): Only go down the NSApp path for the outermost invocation of the runloop.

  - This now starts servers on randomized ports as long as the

  - Use recursive timeout to make sure that the server is around
    before passing it back to a callback. This is currently hacky
    and may occasionally fail. A real solution would be to implement
    an 'alive' endpoint or something that lets apiServer.js know
    that the server is up and running successfully and use that to
    pass back the server.

tprrt/linux-stable,409017847d2014db8ab1da49dd48182af88344b7,libbpf: Generate more efficient BPF_CORE_READ code,"

Existing BPF_CORE_READ() macro generates slightly suboptimal code. If
there are intermediate pointers to be read, initial source pointer is
going to be assigned into a temporary variable and then temporary
variable is going to be uniformly used as a ""source"" pointer for all
intermediate pointer reads. Schematically (ignoring all the type casts),
BPF_CORE_READ(s, a, b, c) is expanded into:
({
	const void *__t = src;
	bpf_probe_read(&__t, sizeof(*__t), &__t->a);
	bpf_probe_read(&__t, sizeof(*__t), &__t->b);

	typeof(s->a->b->c) __r;
	bpf_probe_read(&__r, sizeof(*__r), &__t->c);
})

This initial `__t = src` makes calls more uniform, but causes slightly
less optimal register usage sometimes when compiled with Clang. This can
cascase into, e.g., more register spills.

This patch fixes this issue by generating more optimal sequence:
({
	const void *__t;
	bpf_probe_read(&__t, sizeof(*__t), &src->a); /* <-- src here */
	bpf_probe_read(&__t, sizeof(*__t), &__t->b);

	typeof(s->a->b->c) __r;
	bpf_probe_read(&__r, sizeof(*__r), &__t->c);
})

Networking stack accelerate vlan tag handling by
keeping topmost vlan header in skb. This works as
long as packet remains in OVS datapath. But during
OVS upcall vlan header is pushed on to the packet.
When such packet is sent back to OVS datapath, core
networking stack might not handle it correctly. Following
patch avoids this issue by accelerating the vlan tag
during flow key extract. This simplifies datapath by
bringing uniform packet processing for packets from
all code paths.

Right now when we try to use the SamzaSqlApplicationRunner in yarn mode it goes into the infinite loop because the appRunnerConfig that we try to set is being overwritten by the appRunnerConfig passed by the job and SamzaSqlApplicationRunner keeps creating it again and again in an infinite loop.

Fix : Userconfig for app.runner.class should not override the computed one. Added a test case to validate this.

## Changes made in this PR
  - When lowerbound roundoff errors occur in `mdamath.angle` (i.e. the internal value of `x` becomes < -1.0), the returned angle is now `np.pi` rather than `-np.pi`. 
  - The `if`/`else` construct for roundoff errors has now been switched to an `np.clip()` call.

When an instance is marked as stopped in the DB but is actually running,
the sync_power_states periodic task will try to stop it.  It does this
using the compute API.  The compute API checks the vm state before
proceeding.  The STOPPED state is treated as invalid.  This patch allows
the caller to bypass the state check and makes use of that in this
periodic task.

Summary:
The tool does not correctly handle COFF sections with extended relocation tables (with IMAGE_SCN_LNK_NRELOC_OVFL bit set), this patch fixes this problem.

But I have cheated a bit in the test (to make it smaller) because extended relocation table is supposed to be used when the number of relocations exceeds 65534. Otherwise the test size would be pretty big.

Timekeeping IRQs from CS5536 MFGPT are routed to i8259, which then
triggers the ""cascade"" IRQ on MIPS CPU. Without IRQF_NO_SUSPEND in
cascade_irqaction, MFGPT interrupts will be masked in suspend mode,
and the machine would be unable to resume once suspended.

Previously, MIPS IRQs were not disabled properly, so the original
code appeared to work. Commit a3e6c1eff5 (""MIPS: IRQ: Fix disable_irq on
CPU IRQs"") uncovers the bug. To fix it, add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to
cascade_irqaction.

This commit is functionally identical to 0add9c2f1cff (""MIPS:
Loongson-3: Add IRQF_NO_SUSPEND to Cascade irqaction""), but it forgot
to apply the same fix to Loongson2.

scylladb/seastar,bece15f918507bd34c5346bac6d15de850d1ea6b,seastar-addr2line: don't invoke addr2line multiple times,"

The current script invokes the addr2line binary every time it sees a new
backtrace. This is terribly inefficient. The biggest problem here is not
just the fact that we have to fork a new process, but the fact that
every new invocation has to reload the entire symbol table.

We'll fix this by opening one addr2line process per module we're dealing
with, and then using pipes to communicate with it. As we send an input
line, it will respond with the corresponding output line.

To test this, I fed a file with 7 backtraces to the script before and
after. Aside from verifying that the output is still the same, I timed
the difference to:

Before:
real	1m50.030s
user	1m38.046s
sys	0m11.795s

After:

This CL:

- makes NetworkLocationProvider use ThreadChecker  instead
of being a base::NonThreadSafe.
- removes unnecessary OnWifiDataUpdated() method, the
 contents being merged into  OnWifiDataUpdate() which is called
 instead of semi-duplicated code in RequestPosition(), clarifying
 the logic.
- clarifies the logic in RequestPosition(), were some checks were
 redundant, in particular:  we don't need to test nor invalidate the
 weak pointers. Rationale: RequestPosition() can be called from
 OnPermissionGranted(), the new OnWifiDataUpdate() (ToT's
 OnWifiDataUpdated()) and from the PostDelayedTask in
 StartUpdate(); |weak_factory_|'s HasWeakPointers() was used to
 differentiate those call sites; but this can be done via the |is_...|
 variables:
   if (!is_new_data_available_ || !is_wifi_data_complete_)
 and |weak_factory_|'s pointers are only used to launch the delayed
 RequestPosition() from StartProvider().

Test-wise:  network_location_provider_unittest.cc is pretty
extensive and it's still passing.

tprrt/linux-stable,39806c3f11e206d03e76521c808a96aedfcc58d9,drm/i915: Include register polling in reg_rw traces,"

We generally omit register polling from the i915_reg_rw tracepoint.
Understandable since polling could generate a lot of noise in the
trace. The downside is that the trace is incomplete. As a compromise
let's trace the final register value observed while polling. That
should be generally sufficient to observe what the code should be
doing next.

I suppose in some cases it might make sense to also trace the initial
register value, and maybe the number of times we polled. But that
would require a separate tracepoint so let's leave it for the future.

The other users of _NOTRACE() are i915_pmu and i2c bitbanging,
which I decided to leave alone.

Next we should do something to claw back the tracepoints for
planes and whatnot which were switched to _FW() a while back.
I guess just new macros for raw_rw+trace. The question is
what to call it?

prestodb/presto,8e0bf9b3dceecb2d72e97604e9346f9ccdedb057,Make StageScheduler notify all tasks are scheduled,"

There are three major responsibilities for `SourcePartitionedScheduler`:
- Split schedule
- Task schedule and stage management
- Lifespan schedule

Note `SourcePartitionedScheduler` can be used either as
an `StageScheduler` or `SourceScheduler`. In both case it needs to
take care about split schedule.

- When it's used as a `StageScheduler`, it's always used for
unpartitioned stage (i.e. JOIN/AGGREGATE over remote source.
  - It needs to take care about task schedule
  - It doesn't need to take care about lifespan schedule

- When it's used as a `SourceScheduler`, it's used by a
`FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler` to schedule
table scan sources.
   * It doesn't need to take care about task schedule
     (although today it still do so)
   * It need to take care about lifespan schedule

Historically, `FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler` doesn't call
`stage.transitionToSchedulingSplits()`. And it  relies on
`SourcePartitionedScheduler` to do this stage management,
even `SourcePartitionedScheduler` is used as a `SourceScheduler`.
This is confusing and error-prone, as it should be `StageScheduler`'s
responsibility to do stage management .

This commit makes `FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler` to call
`stage.transitionToSchedulingSplits()`. As a result, it release the
needs for `SourcePartitionedScheduler` from doing this for
grouped execution (in the context of grouped execution,
`SourcePartitionedScheduler` is guaranteed to be used as an
`SourceScheduler`).

In principle, `SourcePartitionedScheduler`  doesn't need to do stage
management at all as long as it's used as a `SourceScheduler` (even for
 ungrouped execution).  This is not done in this commit.

`FixedCountScheduler` doesn't need to call
`stage.transitionToSchedulingSplits()` since it there will be no table
splits to schedule.

1. Only audio is working after this change (for video, you can only hear audio now). Video will be in the next change.
2. Fullscreen implementation is missing in this change, it will come after the video change.

luci/luci-py,90be23fee1ca327a7c7113f7eff949ec90112904,Fix rotating log on the Windows bots when used with subprocesses.,"

Due to the use of subprocess call on Windows, the file handle stays open in the
subprocesses even if the log file is not used. Because of this, when the
RotatingFileHandler tries to os.rename() the file, it fails with:
    WindowsError: [Error 32] The process cannot access the file because it is
    being used by another process

This didn't fail on the other tool (like run_isolated.py) because we were lucky
since the process is relatively short lived, so only a small amount of log was
lost. This fix works around the problem by duplicating the file handle and
forcibly making it not inheritable to the child processes.

This method is now used in webutils.commonentry(), which adds common data items
(commit hash, author, date, etc) for rendering changesets in hgweb. Usually,
commonentry() is given a changectx as ctx; but in views related to files (e.g.
file view, diff, annotate) it's replaced by a filectx, so the latter also needs
to have instabilities() method.

alphagov/whitehall,2f468927c5f8933cdbb7946786ef664b0254383d,Hardcode the asset manifest file,"

TL;DR: The upgrade to Rails 4 introduced a subtle bug that is causing non-
deterministic assets to be served across the servers. This ensures that all
boxes will serve the same assets.

The sprockets gem  behaves slightly differently in Rails 4 land - pre-Rails 4,
it would generate a `public/assets/manifest.yml` file that mapped all the asset
file paths to their compiled versions (e.g. mapped ""application.css"" to the
latest compiled version that would look like
""application-DIGEST-OF-COMPILED-FILE.css""). Rails would then use this manifest
file to include the latest/correct compiled asset in the markup. In Rails 4, the
manifest file is now generated with a different filename - it is generated as
`""manifest-#{SecureRandom.hex(16)}.json""` [1]. This same manifest file is meant
to be reused on each re-compilation (i.e. updated to point to the new assets
that have been compiled), and the sprockets code assumes there is only one. If
there is more than one, then sprockets loads a matching manifest file at random
[2]. And because of the ""special"" way Whitehall compiles and syncs assets on
deploy[3], it always generates a fresh manifest file (with a different hex
digest), meaning there is now more than one! This results in different boxes
showing different asset files based on the particular manifest-HEX.json file
that it happened to load when the Rails process boots.

By explicitly configuring the filepath of the asset manifest file, we force
sprockets to always use the same filename and thus ensure that each server is
using the same manifest.

Note that this is a temporary fix to unblock whitehall deploys. Separate work is
being done to make whitehall less of a ""special snowflake"" and have it compile
assets on the servers instead of compiling locally and rsync-ing.

[1] This change was made to make the manifest file harder to find in the public
directory, revealing the filename and location of all assets on the server.

[2] The Dir glob on the following line returns results in a non-deterministic
order, which means choosing the first result will more than likely give you a
different file on different machines:
https://github.com/rails/sprockets/blob/v3.0.0.beta.8/lib/sprockets/manifest.rb#L48

[3] Instead of doing things the ""Rails Way"" and having each box compile their
own assets, Whitehall's deploy script takes care of compiling the assets locally
before rsync-ing them to the boxes. But because the deploy build is performed on
a clean workspace, there are no existing assets, and thus no existing manifest
file, so it *always* generates a fresh manifest file with a different randomly
generated filename:
https://github.gds/gds/alphagov-deployment/blob/master/whitehall/config/deploy.rb#L49-L50.
This was introduced at a time when we were having problems compiling assets on
the frontend boxes - it would often timeout and fail, forcing us to roll back
deploys. As stated above, it's likely this is no longer necessary and work is
being done separately to make whitehall deploys more ""normal"".

tprrt/linux-stable,0c713cbab6200b0ab6473b50435e450a6e1de85d,Btrfs: fix race between ranged fsync and writeback of adjacent ranges,"

When we do a full fsync (the bit BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC is set in the
inode) that happens to be ranged, which happens during a msync() or writes
for files opened with O_SYNC for example, we can end up with a corrupt log,
due to different file extent items representing ranges that overlap with
each other, or hit some assertion failures.

When doing a ranged fsync we only flush delalloc and wait for ordered
exents within that range. If while we are logging items from our inode
ordered extents for adjacent ranges complete, we end up in a race that can
make us insert the file extent items that overlap with others we logged
previously and the assertion failures.

For example, if tree-log.c:copy_items() receives a leaf that has the
following file extents items, all with a length of 4K and therefore there
is an implicit hole in the range 68K to 72K - 1:

  (257 EXTENT_ITEM 64K), (257 EXTENT_ITEM 72K), (257 EXTENT_ITEM 76K), ...

It copies them to the log tree. However due to the need to detect implicit
holes, it may release the path, in order to look at the previous leaf to
detect an implicit hole, and then later it will search again in the tree
for the first file extent item key, with the goal of locking again the
leaf (which might have changed due to concurrent changes to other inodes).

However when it locks again the leaf containing the first key, the key
corresponding to the extent at offset 72K may not be there anymore since
there is an ordered extent for that range that is finishing (that is,
somewhere in the middle of btrfs_finish_ordered_io()), and it just
removed the file extent item but has not yet replaced it with a new file
extent item, so the part of copy_items() that does hole detection will
decide that there is a hole in the range starting from 68K to 76K - 1,
and therefore insert a file extent item to represent that hole, having
a key offset of 68K. After that we now have a log tree with 2 different
extent items that have overlapping ranges:

 1) The file extent item copied before copy_items() released the path,
    which has a key offset of 72K and a length of 4K, representing the
    file range 72K to 76K - 1.

 2) And a file extent item representing a hole that has a key offset of
    68K and a length of 8K, representing the range 68K to 76K - 1. This
    item was inserted after releasing the path, and overlaps with the
    extent item inserted before.

The overlapping extent items can cause all sorts of unpredictable and
incorrect behaviour, either when replayed or if a fast (non full) fsync
happens later, which can trigger a BUG_ON() when calling
btrfs_set_item_key_safe() through __btrfs_drop_extents(), producing a
trace like the following:

A sample of a corrupt log tree leaf with overlapping extents I got from
running btrfs/072:

              extent data disk bytenr 0 nr 0

              extent data disk bytenr 4343541760 nr 770048
              extent data offset 606208 nr 163840 ram 770048
      item 16 key (295 108 663552) itemoff 2493 itemsize 53
              extent data disk bytenr 4343541760 nr 770048
              extent data offset 610304 nr 155648 ram 770048
      item 17 key (295 108 819200) itemoff 2440 itemsize 53
              extent data disk bytenr 4334788608 nr 4096
              extent data offset 0 nr 4096 ram 4096

The file extent item at offset 659456 (item 15) ends at offset 823296
(659456 + 163840) while the next file extent item (item 16) starts at
offset 663552.

Another different problem that the race can trigger is a failure in the
assertions at tree-log.c:copy_items(), which expect that the first file
extent item key we found before releasing the path exists after we have
released path and that the last key we found before releasing the path
also exists after releasing the path:

  $ cat -n fs/btrfs/tree-log.c
  4080          if (need_find_last_extent) {
  4081                  /* btrfs_prev_leaf could return 1 without releasing the path */
  4082                  btrfs_release_path(src_path);
  4083                  ret = btrfs_search_slot(NULL, inode->root, &first_key,
  4084                                  src_path, 0, 0);
  4085                  if (ret < 0)
  4086                          return ret;
  4087                  ASSERT(ret == 0);
  (...)
  4103                  if (i >= btrfs_header_nritems(src_path->nodes[0])) {
  4104                          ret = btrfs_next_leaf(inode->root, src_path);
  4105                          if (ret < 0)
  4106                                  return ret;
  4107                          ASSERT(ret == 0);
  4108                          src = src_path->nodes[0];
  4109                          i = 0;
  4110                          need_find_last_extent = true;
  4111                  }
  (...)

The second assertion implicitly expects that the last key before the path
release still exists, because the surrounding while loop only stops after
we have found that key. When this assertion fails it produces a stack like
this:

So fix this race between a full ranged fsync and writeback of adjacent
ranges by flushing all delalloc and waiting for all ordered extents to
complete before logging the inode. This is the simplest way to solve the
problem because currently the full fsync path does not deal with ranges
at all (it assumes a full range from 0 to LLONG_MAX) and it always needs
to look at adjacent ranges for hole detection. For use cases of ranged
fsyncs this can make a few fsyncs slower but on the other hand it can
make some following fsyncs to other ranges do less work or no need to do
anything at all. A full fsync is rare anyway and happens only once after
loading/creating an inode and once after less common operations such as a
shrinking truncate.

This is an issue that exists for a long time, and was often triggered by
generic/127, because it does mmap'ed writes and msync (which triggers a
ranged fsync). Adding support for the tree checker to detect overlapping
extents (next patch in the series) and trigger a WARN() when such cases
are found, and then calling btrfs_check_leaf_full() at the end of
btrfs_insert_file_extent() made the issue much easier to detect. Running
btrfs/072 with that change to the tree checker and making fsstress open
files always with O_SYNC made it much easier to trigger the issue (as
triggering it with generic/127 is very rare).

This enforces the exact text that will be read by Chromevox, before
this patch it was reading the whole text content from the element which
was getting duplicated text.

The attribute aria-labelledby is a list of ids of elements whose
whose content is used as label by screen reader/Chromevox.

For list view it adds the |id| of 3 columns: entry-name, size and
modified date.

For grid view it only adds the |id| of entry-name.

We are trying to reliably preserve the newly added row in 'moderation' table,
when the caller of doEditContent() throws MWException, causing a DB rollback.

This test currently fails due to internal sanity checks in commit()
which are designed to specifically prevent what we are trying to do

Possible solution is to allow the rollback and repeat the changes AFTER it.

The code was treating country.length = 0 as valid which doesn't
make any sense. This was explicitly causing the code to NOT fallback
to geoiplookup for IPv6 Geo cookies.

From what I can tell the previous code *never* triggered the fallback
for IPv6 cookies.

Follows-up 9af91ae72adca97 which seems to have caused this regression.
Before that commit, the code used 'mw.centralNotice.data.country'
instead of 'Geo.country' to decide whether to load the fallback lookup
and that property fell back to 'XX' if empty or falsey (includes
empty string). The new code has no default of 'XX', but still treated
empty string as valid value.

Implementation is trial and error, if DVB-T does not lock try DVB-T2

DVB-C still uses normal software ZigZag, DVBFE_ALGO_SW.

arch/cris/arch-v10/drivers/Kconfig:config ETRAX_SERIAL
arch/cris/arch-v10/drivers/Kconfig:     bool ""Serial-port support""

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We don't replace module.h with init.h since the file already has that.

tprrt/linux-stable,d0d538b9d1239ed6ed318a2304ba5a763f835089,KVM: nVMX: fix shadow on EPT,"

72f857950f6f19 broke shadow on EPT. This patch reverts it and fixes PAE
on nEPT (which reverted commit fixed) in other way.

Shadow on EPT is now broken because while L1 builds shadow page table
for L2 (which is PAE while L2 is in real mode) it never loads L2's
GUEST_PDPTR[0-3].  They do not need to be loaded because without nested
virtualization HW does this during guest entry if EPT is disabled,
but in our case L0 emulates L2's vmentry while EPT is enables, so we
cannot rely on vmcs12->guest_pdptr[0-3] to contain up-to-date values
and need to re-read PDPTEs from L2 memory. This is what kvm_set_cr3()
is doing, but by clearing cache bits during L2 vmentry we drop values
that kvm_set_cr3() read from memory.

So why the same code does not work for PAE on nEPT? kvm_set_cr3()
reads pdptes into vcpu->arch.walk_mmu->pdptrs[]. walk_mmu points to
vcpu->arch.nested_mmu while nested guest is running, but ept_load_pdptrs()
uses vcpu->arch.mmu which contain incorrect values. Fix that by using
walk_mmu in ept_(load|save)_pdptrs.

OpenStack: fetch volume path from metadata service

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Updates the OpenStack cloud provider to use the Nova metadata service as a fallback when retrieving mounted PV disk paths. Note that the Nova instance device metadata will contain the disk address and bus, which allows finding its path. 

This is needed as the *standard* mechanism of retrieving disk paths is not available when running k8s under OpenStack Hyper-V hosts.

This is a fix for https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/2209:
by default a file created using open() uses text translation mode so writing
\n to it will result in the file having \r\n. This is obviously problematic
for binary .mpy files, so provide functions for setting the open mode
and use binary mode in mpy-cross' main().

This is wrong in S1G however, so instead get the allowed

chromium/chromium,ca2c9afa7f75f3e35a04c76aa0497003988d60e0,device/fido: rework request cancelation.,"

Previously, FidoDevice::Cancel would cancel any and all requests
outstanding, and could corrupt a multi-frame message that was in the
process of being sent.

This change fixes that and augments the API to allow specific requests
to be canceled. This is important for resident keys because we want to
ensure that resident creation requests are effectively canceled once
moot.

The semantics are the same as the Travis check:

- check pull requests against master
- if pull request has label ""no-changelog-needed"", do nothing
- display an error if there are no diffs on `CHANGES.md`

Compared to the Travis check:

- it retriggers automatically when a label is added or removed
- it will not be subject to API rate limiting
- it is likely to be a bit faster

A couple comments on the implementation:

- the types of pull request events correspond to the default ones plus
  the ones related to labels (so that it triggers a check when labels
  change)
- this uses `actions/checkout@v1` because there is a bug in `v2` that
  can check out the wrong commit sometimes. See actions/checkout#237.",False,,,,,,,comsum_random_batch_12_july_2021,-1,False

magit/magit,352c9d02a5719da73ebdea9b9f62b0bf7b8af8d1,don't try to be smart about not highlighting sections,"

A major problem with the section implementation is that there is next to
no consistency regarding the meaning of the slots TITLE, TYPE, and INFO.
In different contexts and for different ""kinds"" (let's not use ""type"" to
avoid confusion :-) of sections are used to ""identify"" (what that means
also isn't consistent) sections.

As a result that code written with one use-case in mind cannot be used
elsewhere, leading to duplication and a growing number of inconsistencies.

One anomaly with likely is not only the result of this confusion but
probably the cause of many of these inconsistencies is that ""a section
not having a title"" is the (only) way of creating a section that is
never highlighted.

Instead add new slot HIGHLIGHT with defaults to t.

When retract_page_tables() removes a page table to make way for a huge
pmd, it holds huge page lock, i_mmap_lock_write, mmap_write_trylock and
pmd lock; but when collapse_pte_mapped_thp() does the same (to handle the
case when the original mmap_write_trylock had failed), only
mmap_write_trylock and pmd lock are held.

That's not enough.  One machine has twice crashed under load, with ""BUG:
spinlock bad magic"" and GPF on 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b.  Examining the second
crash, page_vma_mapped_walk_done()'s spin_unlock of pvmw->ptl (serving
page_referenced() on a file THP, that had found a page table at *pmd)
discovers that the page table page and its lock have already been freed by
the time it comes to unlock.

Follow the example of retract_page_tables(), but we only need one of huge
page lock or i_mmap_lock_write to secure against this: because it's the
narrower lock, and because it simplifies collapse_pte_mapped_thp() to know
the hpage earlier, choose to rely on huge page lock here.

* The example case is as follows:
  - program binds a pipeline and 4 sets
  - later, program rebinds a different pipeline with incompatible layout
  - all 4 sets are invalid
  - program only binds 2 sets as new program shaders only statically use
    the first 2 sets.
* If we try to 'restore' the invalid set bindings at any point this is
  invalid and can lead to crashes. We need to detect when sets have been
  invalidated and bail out, assuming that the shader only statically
  uses the sets that were valid.
* Of course if that is an unfounded assumption then we are not binding
  sets that will be used, but this is just as invalid as leaving used
  sets as invalid.
* We also need to change the PostVS data fetch, since we can't use the
  set after all used sets, we have to instead see which set is the last
  statically used one and use the next (even if it's in the original
  layout).

Introduce a new, deterministic BatchFix application algorithm. The new algorithm works in the following manner:

When producing code-actions, we keep track of both the code-action and the diagnostic that was used to create it. When we later go and 'apply' the code actions in a single document, we'll process them in diagnostic-location order. Is is as if we took each diagnostic of a document in order, produced the CodeAction for that diagnostic, and then applied that CodeAction.

I also took this opportunity to clean up and parallelize much of this code. We now compute code actions in parallel, and we process all documents in parallel when applying changes. Once all application is done, we can then take all the final results and apply them to the solution.

6) Modified journaled operations so that most do not write to the journal node when they are finished to prevent excessive flushing.

This CL changes it so that only the minimal configuration needed
is used on the buildbots for blimp.

Unit test targets need to be specified on the test bots they run,
which leads to the target being compiled on the respective builder
bot (there are builder/tester pairs specified in recipes).

Since the blimp_unittests target depends on //blimp:blimp, there
is no need for us to manually specify that target anywhere.

The Android GN (dbg) is special in that it currently has no devices
attached, so it is unable to run any tests.

After this CL, the following builders/testers will run and test
the following targets:
- Android GN: compile (blimp_unittests) + test (blimp_unittests)
- Android GN (dbg): compile (blimp_tests)
- Linux Builder: compile (blimp_unittests)
- Linux Tests: test (blimp_unittests)
- Linux Builder (dbg): compile (blimp_unittests)
- Linux Tests (dbg)(1): test (blimp_unittests)

jbakosi/quinoa,3f60c18e6458d9204f681999a962f16b1a9cdf02,Understand errors and convergence rate.,"

This commit collects a bunch of seemingly unrelated changes as a result
of my increased understanding of how the computed numerical errors in
inciter correspond to the convergence rate for smooth problems using
initial uniform mesh refinement to generate fine meshes from coarse
meshes (and using those in a convergence study).

In a nutshell, doing a simple convergence study, e.g., solving the pure
advection equation on the slotted cylinder problem (only advecting the
smooth Gaussian hump), one can compute the convergence rate as p = log2(
Ec / Ef ), where Ec and Eh are the errors computed for the coarse and
the fine resolution meshes, respectively. In this expression, it is
assumed that the largest edge length of the fine mesh is exactly twice
as that of the coarse mesh and that the numerical error is proportional
to C * h^p, where C is some constant, h is the edge length, and p is the
order of convergence. If one solves with and without initial uniform
refinement as the fine and coarse meshes, respectively, however, the
largest edge-length of the fine mesh is NOT twice as long as that of the
coarse mesh (as I have originally assumed), but h_f = sqrt(2)/2 * h_c,
where h_f is the fine-mesh largest edge-length and h_c is the
coarse-mesh largest edge-length. As a result, the convergence rate
becomes p = log2( Ec / Ef ) = log2( C h_c^p / C h_f^p ) = log2[ (2 /
sqrt(2))^p ] = p / 2. This means that we get half the convergence rate
compared to the case where h_f = 2h_c. Therefore, for 2-stage
Runge-Kutta, a measured p = 1, means p is really 2. Thanks to @nncarlson
for pointing this out.

Thus I am now confident that the implemented temporal and spatial
discretization gives p = 2 for smooth problems, as expected, independent
of whether the L1 or the L2 norm is used to compute the errors. For now
this is tested with the adv-diff problem only.

Details on the actual changes:

 * Add new operators to tk::Data:

   - New overloads to compound operator*= and operator*, taking a
     tk::real as the right hand side, besides the existing tk::Data, as
     member functions. This allows new operations involving tk::Data
     objects as: D *= r and D = A * r, where D,A are tk::Data and r is
     tk::real.

   - New operator*, taking a tk::real as the left hand side in D = r *
     A, where D,A are tk::Data and r is tk::real, as non-member function.

   - Add unit tests for the above operators.

 * Replace and simplify the computation of the error. Previously, the L1
   norm was computed across the domain, now we compute the L2 norm instead.
   Both work fine, and there is not much difference in FLOPS so we keep
   L2.

 * Take out computing the total volume. The precise mathematical
   definition of the errors (both L1 and L2) do not require dividing the
   final aggregated sum by the total volume (or its square-root for L2),
   and so this is taken out. This also requires less communication in
   parallel.

 * The multiplier that is different for different stages of a single
   time step, e.g., 1/2 and 1.0 for our 2-stage Runge-Kutta, is now not
   passed down in the PDE hierarchy, because this can simply be applied in
   Carrier::apply(), when the solution updates are applied. This also
   simplifies the interface of PDE::rhs() and thus affects all PDEs
   (Transport and Compflow for now).

 * The diagnostics, i.e., residuals and errors integrated over the whole
  computational domain now have a more detailed explanation in
  Carrier::diagnostics() that explains why and how this data is computed.

 * Remove debug-code from Compflow.h. Still have not decided how density
   will be updated for the vortical flow problem in CompFlowProblem.h:
   either update or not (in that problem the density does not change, so
   it should not matter, but it may affect the convergence rate). This
   will be tested later, so keep the current update as comments for now.

 * Class CompFlowProblemVorticalFlow now also outputs the pressure as
   a field variable.

 * Class Transport now outputs the L2 error of all components
   integrated.

Pull IDR rewrite from Matthew Wilcox:
 ""The most significant part of the following is the patch to rewrite the
  IDR & IDA to be clients of the radix tree. But there's much more,
  including an enhancement of the IDA to be significantly more space
  efficient, an IDR & IDA test suite, some improvements to the IDR API
  (and driver changes to take advantage of those improvements), several
  improvements to the radix tree test suite and RCU annotations.

  The IDR & IDA rewrite had a good spin in linux-next and Andrew's tree
  for most of the last cycle. Coupled with the IDR test suite, I feel
  pretty confident that any remaining bugs are quite hard to hit. 0-day
  did a great job of watching my git tree and pointing out problems; as
  it hit them, I added new test-cases to be sure not to be caught the
  same way twice""

Willy goes on to expand a bit on the IDR rewrite rationale:
 ""The radix tree and the IDR use very similar data structures.

  Merging the two codebases lets us share the memory allocation pools,
  and results in a net deletion of 500 lines of code. It also opens up
  the possibility of exposing more of the features of the radix tree to
  users of the IDR (and I have some interesting patches along those
  lines waiting for 4.12)

  It also shrinks the size of the 'struct idr' from 40 bytes to 24 which
  will shrink a fair few data structures that embed an IDR""

gradle/gradle,6677a62e48d04c0347a82e144c130b56ec568dc0,Don't write in RO dependency cache when parent POM is missing,"

This commit works around a bug whenever the read-only dependency cache
used to contain a parent POM, but it has been cleaned up in between
(for example via the seeding build).

In this case, if a ""consumer"" build uses the read-only cache and
resolves a dependency which has the same parent POM, it will attempt
to write in the read-only dependency cache even if it shouldn't.

The ideal fix would be to avoid tweaking the failsafe cache, but it
appears that some read operations _may_ trigger a write operation
in between (as a cleanup side effect). This commit therefore makes
sure that we don't even attempt to call a write operation in this
case.

Better dwarf2 unwind information is a good thing, it allows better
debugging with kgdb and crash and helps systemtap.

Commit 003086497f07f7f1e67c0c295e261740f822b377 (""Build with
-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm"") disabled some CFI information globally to work
around a module loader bug on powerpc.

But this disables the better unwind tables for all architectures, not just
powerpc.  Move the workaround to powerpc and also add a suitable comment
that's it really a workaround.

This improves dwarf2 unwind tables on x86 at least.

Import now works even if classes to import are missing from the classpath

* commit 'c09de4fe26f7619817cd8e8d6f481e073e7c7ebc': (155 commits)
  Fixed some analysis warnings
  Sanity check actually takes 1/8 CPU time during performance test, which is not really worth it
  We can skip Class.forName(..) and just resolve the type directly from our class
  String.matches(..) and String.replaceAll(..) are also expensive
  It's sad, but String.format(..) is noticeably slow
  getCaller is possibly expensive -> make sure we only call it once. Also we don't need to handle NoClassDefFound anymore, since we're handling resolving from classpath in once dedicated spot.
  getAll... is possibly expensive (when called extensively), so we do it only once
  Make import resilient against duplicate classes on the classpath
  JavaType class name validation was too strict
  Increased version to 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT, since the core meanwhile changed so much. Also the FIXME is now obsolete, since array type handling is centralized, so tests will definitely fail, if something is broken there.
  JavaClass has now modifiers
  Added reflect back to JavaMember, since it doesn't do any harm now and can be implemented consistently thanks to CallTarget in JavaCall instead of directly using a JavaMember as target (which made problems, when the target was ambiguous and thus reflect would behave unexpectedly)
  Importing classes outside of the classpath works now
  Architecture test finally works
  Resolving super types does not do redundant classForName anymore, ClassResolver thus doesn't need getSuperTypes() anymore and ReflectionUtils can be moved to archunit-junit.
  ASM claims superName == java/lang/Object for interfaces, so we have to add a workaround that removes the superclass to be consistent with the reflection API. Also the simple name for anonymous classes is now consistent with the reflection API.
  Clean up -> IdentifiedTarget was meanwhile obsolete
  Encapsulate all type name aspects in JavaType - Moved all type name logic into JavaType and created specific classes for primitives, objects and arrays. Also moved resolution of classes into JavaType.
  Encapsulate all type name aspects in JavaType - JavaType is now an interface with one implementation
  Encapsulate all type name aspects in JavaType - Move factory methods to inner class so we can make JavaType an interface

Some it821x RAID firmwares return 0 for the err return off both devices.
A similar issue occurs with the slave returning 0 not 1 if you plug a
gigabyte sata ramdisk into a controller that fakes two SATA ports as
master/slave on an SFF channel.

The patch does the following

- Allow the 'failed diagnostics' case on both master and slave
- Move the HORKAGE_DIAGNOSTIC check after ->dev_config

This second change also allows IT821x to fix up a problem where we report
drive diagnostic failures when in fact the drive is fine but the
microcontroller firmware doesn't appear to get it right. IT821x clears
the flag again to avoid giving the user bogus warnings about their disk.

The other IT821x change is a bit ugly, we slightly abuse the cable type
hook to fiddle with the identify data for the devices. We could add a new
hook for this but as we have only one offender and no more seeming likely
it seems better to keep libata-core clean.

Please let this sit in -mm briefly, just in case the relaxed checking
breaks some other emulated interface.

This was leftover crap from kill-agp. The current code is theoretically
broken for 64b bars. (I resist removing theoretically because I am too
lazy to test).

Metadata for geometric fields was not being properly stored by
the slave in its the table definition. This happened because
MYSQL_TYPE_GEOMETRY was not included in the 'switch... case' that
handles field metadata according to the field type. Therefore, it
would default to 0, leading to always have a mismatch between

The 2008r2 tester has been failing with an error like:

```
  1) Chef::Resource::WindowsTask action :enable enables the disabled task
     Failure/Error: expect(current_resource.task.status).to eq(""not scheduled"")

       expected: ""not scheduled""

     # ./spec/functional/resource/windows_task_spec.rb:1481:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'
```

This has only been happening on the enable and disable tests and appears to be a timing issue. This change gives thoses tests unique names and changes the default name to not be 'chef-client' which is more likely to collide with another test.

This change has passed chef-test on jenkins in an ad-hoc test.

We avoid unnecessary strings in Unescape, as checking the length is sufficient.

We reserve the capacity of the output of Escape, to reduce the number of grows. Also, replacing push_back with append improves performance on Windows, as push_back is badly implemented in MSVC (~3x slower).

 * Commented out a large chunk of the process_relationships function that

   compilation that was added in SQLAlchemy 0.2.3.  I left it in the code, but

Commit 37c3dfc9 sets the wait status on only the child pid. It
intended to match the pid only once to protect against pid reuse but it
won't because the indicator was reset to 0 every time at the top of the
loop. If the child pid is reused, the wait status will be set again.
Fix by setting indicator outside the loop.

The ISAPNP spec recommends that independent options precede
dependent ones, but this is not actually required.  The current
ISAPNP code incorrectly puts such trailing independent options
at the end of the last dependent option list.

This patch fixes that bug by resetting the current option list
to the independent list when we see an ""End Dependent Functions""
tag.  PNPBIOS and PNPACPI handle this the same way.

tprrt/linux-stable,c06d68b814d556cff5a4dc589215f5ed9f0b7fd5,USB: xhci: Minimize HW event ring dequeue pointer writes.,"

The xHCI specification suggests that writing the hardware event ring dequeue
pointer register too often can be an expensive operation for the xHCI hardware
to manage.  It suggests minimizing the number of writes to that register.

Originally, the driver wrote the event ring dequeue pointer after each
event was processed.  Depending on how the event ring moderation register
is set up and how fast the transfers are completing, there may be several
events processed for each interrupt.  This patch makes the hardware event
ring dequeue pointer be written only once per interrupt.

Make the transfer event handler and port status event handler only write
the software event ring dequeue pointer.  Move the updating of the
hardware event ring dequeue pointer into the interrupt function.  Move the
contents of xhci_set_hc_event_deq() into the interrupt handler.  The
interrupt handler must clear the event handler busy flag, so it might as
well also write the dequeue pointer to the same register.  This eliminates
two 32-bit PCI reads and two 32-bit PCI writes.

compressor directly - instead it prepends the uncompressed length,
in 4-byte little-endian (!) encoding, to the compressed chunk.
We don't need this extra information - we already know the expected
uncompressed chunk length, so we need to just skip it.

tprrt/linux-stable,ecd322c9b3e4ac70f9f108badde3eb6b99c7993d,[ARM] Add cmpxchg support for ARMv6+ systems (v5),"

Add cmpxchg/cmpxchg64 support for ARMv6K and ARMv7 systems
(original patch from Catalin Marinas <15ce75b290ebaf27c3f9fd73ab848685ed3d8261@arm.com>)

The cmpxchg and cmpxchg64 functions can be implemented using the
LDREX*/STREX* instructions. Since operand lengths other than 32bit are
required, the full implementations are only available if the ARMv6K
extensions are present (for the LDREXB, LDREXH and LDREXD instructions).

For ARMv6, only 32-bits cmpxchg is available.

Mathieu :

Make cmpxchg_local always available with best implementation for all type sizes (1, 2, 4 bytes).
Make cmpxchg64_local always available.

Use ""Ir"" constraint for ""old"" operand, like atomic.h atomic_cmpxchg does.

Change since v3 :
- Add ""memory"" clobbers (thanks to Nicolas Pitre)
- removed __asmeq(), only needed for old compilers, very unlikely on ARMv6+.

Note : ARMv7-M should eventually be ifdefed-out of cmpxchg64. But it's not
supported by the Linux kernel currently.

Put back arm < v6 cmpxchg support.

However, on windows these paths are not valid URLs, which iOS can't
handle. Therefore revert to using the relative unix-like paths on iOS.

Some of the test timers and loops have been made to be less aggressive so that
they run and complete even when run under gperf memory profiler

Also added an option to task_util::WaitForIdle() to not to fail the test if
scheduler never becomes empty. In some of the busy integration tests such as
graceful_restart_test, scheduler always remains busy due to timers and IO
activities

extent_invalidatepage() will try to clear all possible bits since it's
calling clear_extent_bit() with delete == 1.

This is currently fine, since for btree io tree, it only utilizes
EXTENT_LOCK bit.  But this could be a problem for later subpage support,
which will utilize extra io tree bit to represent additional info.

This patch will just convert that clear_extent_bit() to
unlock_extent_cached().

For current code since only EXTENT_LOCKED bit is utilized, this doesn't
change the behavior, but provides a much cleaner basis for incoming
subpage support.

Instead of iterating over the leaves to find repeated substrings, and walking
collecting leaf children when we don't necessarily need them, let's just
calculate what we need and iterate over that.

By doing this, we don't have to save every leaf. It's easier to read the code
too and understand what's going on.

The goal here, at the end of the day, is to set up to allow us to do something
like

for (RepeatedSubstring &RS : ST) {
 ... do stuff with RS ...
}

Which would let us perform the cost model stuff and the repeated substring
query at the same time.

Do not load the Intel pstate driver if the platform firmware
(ACPI BIOS) supports the power management alternatives.
The ACPI BIOS indicates that the OS control mode can be used
if the _PSS (Performance Supported States) is defined in ACPI
table. For the OS control mode, the Intel pstate driver will be
loaded.

HP BIOS has several power management modes (firmware, OS-control and
so on). For the OS control mode in HP BIOS, the Intel p-state driver
will be loaded. When the customer chooses the firmware power
management in HP BIOS, the Intel p-state driver will be ignored.

I put hw_vendor_info vendor_info in case other vendors (Dell, Lenovo...)
have their firmware power management. Vendors should make sure their
firmware power management works properly, and they can go for adding
their vendor info to the variable.

VideoToolbox can fall back to software internally for two reasons:
  1) The resolution is below the minimum (or other format incompatibility). Eventually we want Chromium to handle
fallback in this case.
  2) The sandbox was not initialized properly. This we want to know about and fix.

This CL does not distinguish the two cases.

qtproject/qt-labs-qbs,b5573c479f361ea280f0607ef0d042d9285df9e0,Solve the Java dependency tracking issue once and for all.,"

This approach relies on the newly introduced ability of Modules to
contain Groups, which may add additional source files to a Product.

In the case of the Java module, the module includes a group which adds
some sources to build a helper tool on-demand for each product that
builds Java source code. This deviates from the previous approach of
supplying a single jar for the entire qbs distribution and is thus
somewhat less efficient, but is not expected to be a critical issue in
the short term.

To start, it solves two critical issues: the build-time dependency on
javac, which complicates the qbs build process unnecessarily, and the
bootstrap class path warning due to targeting Java 1.6 with newer JDKs.

google/llvm-propeller,f67433abd9e9a07f030806397d7ef831537fabf4,SCEVAffinator: pass parameter-only set to addRestriction if BB=nullptr,"

Assumptions can either be added for a given basic block, in which case the set
describing the assumptions is expected to match the dimensions of its domain.
In case no basic block is provided a parameter-only set is expected to describe
the assumption.

The piecewise expressions that are generated by the SCEVAffinator sometimes
have a zero-dimensional domain (e.g., [p] -> { [] : p <= -129 or p >= 128 }),
which looks similar to a parameter-only domain, but is still a set domain.

This change adds an assert that checks that we always pass parameter domains to
addAssumptions if BB is empty to make mismatches here fail early.

We also change visitTruncExpr to always convert to parameter sets, if BB is
null. This change resolves http://llvm.org/PR30941

Another alternative to this change would have been to inspect all code to make
sure we directly generate in the SCEV affinator parameter sets in case of empty
domains. However, this would likely complicate the code which combines parameter
and non-parameter domains when constructing a statement domain. We might still
consider doing this at some point, but as this likely requires several non-local
changes this should probably be done as a separate refactoring.

Commit 012f7939784358b02726c169543aa99436439335 was a bit misguided in its
thinking, and resulted in a package built without asciidoc enabled not
installing the manpages to the system on a 'make install' operation. Fix
this behavior by making manpages required in a normal build, and in order to
disable their existence, the '--disable-doc' option must be used.

Hopefully this solves manpage issues for both developers and package
builders while allowing as much flexibility as possible.

Any set_lcd_level() call can fail for one of two reasons: either
requested brightness is outside the allowed range or the ACPI method
used for setting brightness level is not available.  For
bl_update_status(), the first case is handled by backlight core, which
means bl_update_status() will not even be called if requested brightness
is outside the allowed range.  The second case will be logged anyway by
set_lcd_level() itself, so there is no point in generating another
message in bl_update_status().  Remove the superfluous debug message
along with a local variable that is now redundant.

not transparently reuse the name fully to make a complete test. This for
one resulted in old versions of NetworkManager being queried, yet the final
build was disabled. If cmake was ran a 2nd time the cache was refreshed and

The old scheme for mapping the vDSO text is rather complicated.
vdso2c generates a struct vm_special_mapping and a blank .pages
array of the correct size for each vdso image.  Init code in
vdso/vma.c populates the .pages array for each vDSO image, and
the mapping code selects the appropriate struct
vm_special_mapping.

With .fault, we can use a less roundabout approach: vdso_fault()
just returns the appropriate page for the selected vDSO image.

While this doesn't come up in reasonable cases currently (the only user
defined types not in type units are ones without linkage - which makes
for near-ODR violations, because it'd be a type with linkage referencing
a type without linkage - such a type can't be validly defined in more
than one TU, so arguably it shouldn't be in a type unit to begin with -
but it's a convenient way to demonstrate an issue that will become more
revalent with homed modular debug info type definitions - which also
don't need to be in type units but more legitimately so).

Precursor to the Clang change to de-type-unit (by omitting the
'identifier') types homed due to strong linkage vtables. (making that
change without this one would lead to major type duplication in type
units)

The DRBG callbacks 'get_entropy()' and 'cleanup_entropy()' are designed
in such a way that the randomness buffer does not have to be allocated
by the calling function. It receives the address of a dynamically
allocated buffer from get_entropy() and returns this address to
cleanup_entropy(), where it is freed. If these two calls are properly
paired, the address can be stored in a stack local variable of the
calling function, so there is no need for having a 'randomness' member
(and a 'filled' member) in 'RAND_DRBG'.

This fixes the use counter for tracking cases where URL fragments have
a superfluous hash character. Previously we would count ##targetText in
the URL if the targetText feature was disabled. However, that
invalidates the metric since we expect an uptick in these kinds of urls
even if the feature is disabled.

We're trying to find out how often we see a '#' in a URL fragment to
determine the compatibility impact (since this is an invalid URL today).
This CL prevents counting any URL with ""#targetText="" in the fragment.

Convert the ixgbe pmd driver to use the PMD_REGISTER_DRIVER macro.
This means that the test applications now have no reference to the ixgbe library
when building DSO's and must specify its use on the command line with the -d
option.  Static linking will still initalize the driver automatically.

emberjs/ember.js,b8a6288f198f4991b73c0590d662d78091a7b66f,Untangle autoboot and globalsMode code paths,"

Conceptually, these are two orthgonal things – autoboot happens to be
the opt-in for disabling support for globals mode.

After this refactor, autoboot is literally just calling `boot()` at
DOM Ready and *then* creating a instance automatically for you.
Conversely, you mustcall `boot()` yourself if you disable autoboot).

Most of the globals mode featue are already deprecated in 1.x.
Separating the two concepts allow us to review and remove those
feaatures independently.

Locally overriding the flags to use the `(autoboot: true, globalsMode:
false)` combo and running the tests would reveal all the places we are
relying on them internally.

openstack/neutron,f9b2791735863b58171ee8be46c47ef3ed2c5edd,Prevent calling waitall() inside a GreenPool's greenthread,"

When neutron-server is running with several api workers
sending it a termination signal (SIGTERM, SIGHUP or SIGINT)
leads to waitall() being called inside a GreenPool's greenthread.

The reason is that a wsgi server is started in a green thread
from the same green pool that is passed to the server itself
to be used for spawning client green threads.

To avoid it, it is reasonable to use different pools for spawning
a wsgi server and for its internal usage.

This is also the case for metadata agent running with several
metadata workers.

SAP/openui5,d3d537b63db4465fae9b10044bab7a39e4822938,[INTERNAL] sap.m.OverflowToolbar: Corrected order of grouped controls in overflow,"

Background:
- when a toolbar child control is moved to the overflow, it is added to the *beginning* of the list [of overflowed controls];
- when a *group* of toolbar child controls is moved to the overflow, each group member is added to the *beginning* of the list [of overflowed controls];

Problem:
The overflow logic decribed in point 2 above makes *grouped* items appear in *reverse order in the overflow*

Corrected the ordering of grouped controls, so that order of *grouped controls* within overflow is the same as their order outside overflow
(i.e. left-most control outside overflow has top-most position within overflow).

Ensured that the grouped controls preserve in the overflow the same order as outside of overflow.

apache/jmeter,bfabdb8fc84b992ab73c516f591ac5d08da1b0a7,Use a sane initial dir for the file chooser,"

While having a look at 63945, I found a few places, where we look for the existence
of the initial directory on which the file chooser should start.

I extended and simplified those occurrences and think I found a bug in the logic that
chooses the initial location in FileDialoger#promptToOpenFile from line 177.

First we look, if existingFileName is pointing to something valid and use that as the
initial location or the global initial location, if none location has been used before.

After that a bit further down, we test if a location has been used before and may
initialize such a location.

Than -- and this is the potential bug -- we always use that location for the initial
location of the file chooser.

Another dodgy logic is that we test for the default initial location in two different ways.
First -- when no existingFileName is given -- we test for an empty default location and refuse
to use it, if it is empty. The second time, we accept the default location, even if it is
empty AND use it as the default location for the next runs.

This uses the example UDDF file from Jan Schubert's Heinrichs Weikamp
DR5 dives, and now parses the dive dates, the cylinder mixes and the gas
switch events correctly (or at least partially).

It's not perfect: the gas mix has an ""id"" field that we ignore, and
instead we just depend on the cylinders being in order (which they seem
to be).  And I have rather limited test-cases, so maybe something else
is messed up too.  But for the six example dives I have, this gives
reasonable data.

grpc/grpc,957fc7bab7d427878d2dd0def19dfffa5cd111fd,Don't require_relative for an absolute path,"

Ruby's `require_relative` method currently converts paths to absolute
paths. This idiosyncrasy means that the implementation of the require
for the distributed shared library works, however the semantics do not
mesh with the semantics of `require_relative`.

This is an issue when you redefine `require_relative` and follow the
semantics of the method, as [derailed_benchmarks does][1]. This means
that any project that uses `grpc` also cannot use that project (which
I will also be patching).

In the event that a new version of Ruby follows the semantics of the
method (whether or not that is likely), this will break as well.

By switching to `require` here instead of `require_relative`, we
maintain the functionality but do not use a semantically incompatible
method to do so.

HTMLElement with formAssociated flag didn't have code to close a
validation bubble on blur. HTMLFormControlElement had it in
DispatchBlurEvent(). This CL adds a focus change callback to
ValidationMessageClient, ChromeClientImpl calls it, and
ValidationMessageClientImpl closes a visible validation bubble in
it.  We don't need to override DispatchBlurEvent() in each of
form control classes.

This CL also fixes internals.isValidationMessageVisible() so that it
supports form-associated custom elements.

tprrt/linux-stable,33467ac3c8dc80575e1b158e78d0c30ab33c1b08,remoteproc: Add prepare and unprepare ops,"

On some SoC architecture, it is needed to enable HW like
clock, bus, regulator, memory region... before loading
co-processor firmware.

This patch introduces prepare and unprepare ops to execute
platform specific function before firmware loading and after
stop execution.

2) Apply patch
3) Go to cgi-bin/koha/errors/401.pl --> Check that it now says ""This error means that you aren't authorized to view this page."" and ""Please log in and try again."". Check that 'log in' redirects to the log in page (mainpage.pl).
4) Go to cgi-bin/koha/errors/403.pl --> Check that it now says ""This error means that you are forbidden to view this page.""
5) Go to cgi-bin/koha/errors/404.pl --> This page should be very different. Check that the 'Error 404' is now in italics and not bold. Check that the page gives a list of reasons the user may have been given this error and some options for their next step.

channelcat/sanic,87c24e5a7cd629c25f100e77b35bbebb1b9fe210,Prevent flooding of meaningless traceback in `sanic_endpoint_test`,"

When Sanic has an exception in a request middleware, it fails to
save request object in `results`. In `sanic_endpoint_test`, because
it always requires `results` to have both `request` and `response` objects,
it prints traceback like attached example. It is not a user code and
it doesn't give any information to users, it is better to suppress
to print this kind of error.

To fix it, this patch insert collect hook as first request middleware
to guarantee to successfully run it always.

Changes in the ResultSet and ResultSetMetaData for JDK 1.6 meant that BeanUtils tests no longer compiled. However implementing the methods would prevent it from compiling under earlier JDK versions. To resolve this the mock implementations have been converted to implement InvocationHandler (rather than ResultSet/ResultSetMetaData) and factory methods provided to create proxies.

tprrt/linux-stable,db2173198b9513f7add8009f225afa1f1c79bcc6,powerpc/powernv/pci: Work around races in PCI bridge enabling,"

The generic code is racy when multiple children of a PCI bridge try to
enable it simultaneously.

This leads to drivers trying to access a device through a
not-yet-enabled bridge, and this EEH errors under various
circumstances when using parallel driver probing.

There is work going on to fix that properly in the PCI core but it
will take some time.

x86 gets away with it because (outside of hotplug), the BIOS enables
all the bridges at boot time.

This patch does the same thing on powernv by enabling all bridges that
have child devices at boot time, thus avoiding subsequent races. It's
suitable for backporting to stable and distros, while the proper PCI
fix will probably be significantly more invasive.

antirez/redis,b2cd9fcab6122ccbf8b08f71f59a0af01931083b,Fix GEORADIUS edge case with huge radius.,"

This commit closes issue #3698, at least for now, since the root cause
was not fixed: the bounding box function, for huge radiuses, does not
return a correct bounding box, there are points still within the radius
that are left outside.

So when using GEORADIUS queries with radiuses in the order of 5000 km or
more, it was possible to see, at the edge of the area, certain points
not correctly reported.

Because the bounding box for now was used just as an optimization, and
such huge radiuses are not common, for now the optimization is just
switched off when the radius is near such magnitude.

Three test cases found by the Continuous Integration test were added, so
that we can easily trigger the bug again, both for regression testing
and in order to properly fix it as some point in the future.

google/gvisor,c9446f05347b865d75bfdacd6769fce265171b9b,Fix two bugs in TCP sender.,"

a) When GSO is in use we should not cap the segment to maxPayloadSize in
   sender.maybeSendSegment as the GSO logic will cap the segment to the correct
   size. Without this the host GSO is not used as we end up breaking up large
   segments into small MSS sized segments before writing the packets to the
   host.

b) The check to not split a segment due to it not fitting in the receiver window
   when there are pending segments is incorrect as segments in writeList can be
   really large as we just take the write call's buffer size and create a single
   large segment. So a write of say 128KB will just be 1 segment in the
   writeList.

   The linux code checks if 1 MSS sized segments fits in the receiver's window
   and if not then does not split the current segment. gVisor's check was
   incorrect that it was checking if the whole segment which could be >>> 1 MSS
   would fit in the receiver's window. This was causing us to prematurely stop
   sending and falling back to retransmit timer/probe from the other end to send
   data.

This was seen when running HTTPD benchmarks where @ HEAD when sending large
files the benchmark was taking forever to run.

The tcp_splitseg_mss_test.go is being deleted as the test as written doesn't
test what is intended correctly. This is because GSO is enabled by default and
the reason the MSS+1 sized segment is sent is because GSO is in use. A proper
test will require disabling GSO on linux and netstack which is going to take a
bit of work in packetimpact to do it correctly.

Separately a new test probably should be written that verifies that a segment >
availableWindow is not split if the availableWindow is < 1 MSS.

Clean up page migration a little more by calling remove_migration_ptes()
from the same level, on success or on failure, from __unmap_and_move() or
from unmap_and_move_huge_page().

Don't reset page->mapping of a PageAnon old page in move_to_new_page(),
leave that to when the page is freed.  Except for here in page migration,
it has been an invariant that a PageAnon (bit set in page->mapping) page
stays PageAnon until it is freed, and I think we're safer to keep to that.

And with the above rearrangement, it's necessary because zap_pte_range()
wants to identify whether a migration entry represents a file or an anon
page, to update the appropriate rss stats without waiting on it.

Summary:
We want to keep the cached layouts in the LayoutState instead keeping them on the Component instance, because this guarantees that a cached InternalNode would only be accessed on a single thread (since LayoutStates are bound to a single thread).
This diff moves the caching to the LayoutState. The caching tests that used a measured component to verify that layout caching works had to be changed to reuse the same LayoutState instance to verify caching. That's why some tests had to be moved to the powermock package: we needed to static mock ComponentsPools so that we can force the same layoutState instance to be returned when acquiring and be able to verify caching.

This is done by changing the RateStatistics so that it resets its window when the accumulator is empty. It also keeps a dynamic window, so that the rates computed before a full window worth of data has been received will be computed over a smaller window. This means that the rate will be closer to the true rate, but with a higher variance.

After a second run, puppet tries to change the SElinux context:

This patch aims to set selinux_ignore_defaults to True for the File
resource (/etc/systemd/system/rabbitmq-server.service.d).

Thanks to that patch, Puppet will be indempotent between all runs on

Removing them from nic_save, nic_load makes any

        WebIDL conversions from string to number and array to number should not generate TypeError
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49218

        Recent SVG-related changes to the StrictTypeChecking extended attribute in
        CodeGeneratorJS.pm and CodeGeneratorV8.pm were not correct according to the Web IDL and
        ECMA-262 specifications. In particular, when an attribute or function argument is specified
        as a number type (floating-point or integer), passing in a String or object is not supposed
        to raise an exception.

        The original intent of the StrictTypeChecking extended attribute was to properly raise
        TypeError when an interface type is required, but the supplied object does not implement the
        interface type (http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/#es-interface). Historically WebKit has
        silently passed null to the C++ bindings in this case. The handling of strings in the
        original StrictTypeChecking implementation was also incorrect, raising exceptions when it
        should not.

        The semantics of StrictTypeChecking have been changed to enforce only the restrictions on
        interface types. The V8 custom bindings for WebGL have been updated to match the behavior of
        the autogenerated code.

manually, but it is nonetheless very confusing. Fix it and add a bit
more documentation to explain how cached buffers are handled.

ts_skip and ts_die won't work from subshell. Now we simply use
TS_DEVICE which is globally set in that function.

I've made sure that we never change TS_DEVICE variable after
we've got it. So we could use it again for cleanup on exit in
ts_{finalize,die,skip} functions.

tprrt/linux-stable,c6d308534aef6c99904bf5862066360ae067abc4,UBSAN: run-time undefined behavior sanity checker,"

UBSAN uses compile-time instrumentation to catch undefined behavior
(UB).  Compiler inserts code that perform certain kinds of checks before
operations that could cause UB.  If check fails (i.e.  UB detected)
__ubsan_handle_* function called to print error message.

So the most of the work is done by compiler.  This patch just implements
ubsan handlers printing errors.

GCC has this capability since 4.9.x [1] (see -fsanitize=undefined
option and its suboptions).
However GCC 5.x has more checkers implemented [2].
Article [3] has a bit more details about UBSAN in the GCC.

colinsc/koha,bf551a07222a7b9beffd7ca6cba38c675aa3ab28,Bug 18152 : fix unimarc label in SetMarcUnicodeFlag,"

The standard UNIMARC requires than the 9th character (starting from 0) in
labels must be blank (while it may be 'a' in marc21)

the problem is that C4::Charset::SetMarcUnicodeFlag (called in particular when
we import a record) always add 'a' char in the 9th label'pos whereas it should
do it just for MARC21 and NORMARC (not for UNIMARC) :

C4::Charset::SetMarcUnicodeFlag add 'a' char in the 9th label character for
MARC21 and NORMARC (it's normal), but just before doing this it call
""$marc_record->encoding('UTF-8')"" which is a MARC::Record function which, when
called with 'UTF-8' parameter, do only one thing : add 'a' char in the 9th
label character

This patch only removes this incorrect function call, so, when we import a bib
record in UNIMARC : it no longer adds erroneous character (this does not change
anything for MARC21 and NORMARC because SetMarcUnicodeFlag explicitly adds 'a'
char in the 9th label for them)

nanoseconds, the maximum time duration that can be set is limited to

Also use the right format specifiers in debug prints in both core.c,

chromium/chromium,a35383b99ad2c43f7587b0ee5f5aff2b1b4e846e,Limit tabstrip width to its preferred width.,"

Prior to this CL, the tabstrip always occupies the entire width of the
titlebar area (minus the caption buttons). Changing this allows us to
lay out the NTB just to the right of the tabstrip view itself instead
of having the tabstrip control the NTB's bounds. This CL does that
by simply changing the FlexRule governing the tabstrip's width (and
fixing the numerous resulting bugs).

This is a modified reland of https://crrev.com/c/2336296. Changes from
that version:
- PreferredSizeChanged() while dragging, since the dragged tabs may have
been moved past the previous extents of the tabstrip.
- Take tab closing mode into account when determining the tab area's
preferred width.
- Bypass ScrollView when observing the tabstrip's preferred size changes.
- PreferredSizeChanged() in SnapToIdealBounds, since the tabs may have
been snapped outside the previous extents of the tabstrip.

Known issues:
- Tab closing mode doesn't play nicely with scrolling in all cases. That
was true before this CL, but this moves around which cases are broken.

Previously, the shutdown hook was only registered once refresh has
completed. If the JVM was shut down during refresh (or after refresh
and before the hook was registered) the hook wouldn't run and the
partially refreshed context would not be cleaned up.

This commit moves the registration of the shutdown hook to before
refresh processing begins. This ensures that the hook is available
to clean up the context if the JVM is shutdown while refresh is in
progress.

shemminger/iproute2,f28c910274fdec783f73732f38c8a15b1a6aaa0a,devlink: Add devlink reload action and limit options,"

Add reload action and reload limit to devlink reload command to enable
the user to select the reload action required and constrains limits on
these actions that he may want to ensure.

The following reload actions are supported:
  driver_reinit: driver entities re-initialization, applying
                 devlink-param and devlink-resource values.
  fw_activate: firmware activate.

The uAPI is backward compatible, if the reload action option is omitted
from the reload command, the driver reinit action will be used.
Note that when required to do firmware activation some drivers may need
to reload the driver. On the other hand some drivers may need to reset
the firmware to reinitialize the driver entities. Therefore, the devlink
reload command returns the actions which were actually performed.

By default reload actions are not limited and driver implementation may
include reset or downtime as needed to perform the actions. However, if
reload limit is selected, the driver should perform only if it can do it
while keeping the limit constraints.

Reload limit added:
  no_reset: No reset allowed, no down time allowed, no link flap and no
            configuration is lost.

Command examples:
$devlink dev reload pci/0000:82:00.0 action driver_reinit
reload_actions_performed:
  driver_reinit

$devlink dev reload pci/0000:82:00.0 action fw_activate
reload_actions_performed:
  driver_reinit fw_activate

devlink dev reload pci/0000:82:00.1 action driver_reinit -jp
{
    ""reload"": {
        ""reload_actions_performed"": [ ""driver_reinit"" ]
    }
}

devlink dev reload pci/0000:82:00.0 action fw_activate -jp
{
    ""reload"": {
        ""reload_actions_performed"": [ ""driver_reinit"",""fw_activate"" ]
    }

When calling select(pagingItem:) while the view controller was not
visible, the menu items would get out of sync when navigating
back. This happened because the state never changed to .scrolling and
therefore the .cancelScrolling event was triggered. To fix this we
need to check that the state is actually .scrolling before calling the
.cancelScrolling event.

NUM_WORDS and ORDINAL_WORDS are currently not used, but the hard-coded
list should be removed from orth.pyx and replaced to use
language-specific functions. This will later allow other languages to
use their own functions to set those flags. (In English, this is easier
because it only needs to be checked against a set – in German for
example, this requires a more complex function, as most number words
are one word.)

Use a simple (and maybe not optimal) heuristic to either duplicate,
or reduce by half, the buckets array, when items are respectively
added or removed from the hash table.  This heuristic can be tuned
later.

While new buckets for entries will be found during the rehashing
process, there's no need to calculate the hash again during

When an event type is registered, an exception is raised if the given
event type is already registered.

This has the unfortunate side-effect that if a plugin registers any
event types, that plugin cannot be reloaded. The reason is that when
a plugin is unloaded, its registered events are not unregistered.

As a workaround for this, simply remove the check for duplicate event
types. Long term we will need to find a way to make plugins remove
their events from the list on unload.

This commits automates the process of setting up online repositories for
Red Hat Ceph Storage on Debian nodes. The manual steps are currently
described here:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/2/html/installation_guide_for_ubuntu/prerequisites#online_repositories

If you are an RHCS customer and run a Debian based system you can now
access package through the Red Hat CDN.
For this set: ceph_rhcs and ceph_rhcs_cdn_install to true. Then set your
customer credentials in ceph_rhcs_cdn_debian_repo. Replace
customername:customerpasswd with your details.

thoughtbot/high_voltage,8651832bdd0e438a03eecfdeff623aadbcfe2e11,Rework PageFinder restrictions,"

The idea behind this rework is that PageFinder should reject a page_id
if and only if it does not resolve to a sub-path of content_path.  This
changes the previous behavior in the following ways:

* non-ASCII characters are now allowed (e.g. ""résumé"" => ""pages/résumé"")

* page_ids with leading dots are now explicitly allowed (e.g.
  "".gitconfig"" => ""pages/.gitconfig"") [NOTE: this could already be
  hacked into working with e.g. ""_/../.file"" => ""pages/.file"" or
  ""subdir/.file"" => ""pages/subdir/.file""]

* page_ids which resolve to outside the content_path immediately error,
  instead of coercing to a sub-path (e.g. ""../secret"" => error, instead
  of ""../secret"" => ""pages/secret"")

* the trailing slash on content_path is now optional (previously,
  forgetting the trailing slash resulted in a confusing 404)

This rework also removes (obsoletes?) a subtle bug in the page_id
character whitelist wherein ""+-="" was interpreted as (""+""..""="") instead
of [""+"", ""-"", ""=""].  Ironically, this bug is what allowed nested paths
in page_ids to work at all.

fewer function calls than do Pythons 3.3 and 3.4.)

The third test concerned Python's built-in ""inspect"" module. Python 3.5

through the RenderProcessHostImpl::Cleanup call. This means that in
regular cross-process navigations, when the process is no longer in use,
only RenderProcessHostDestroyed is notified. Such behavior prevents us
from being able to write an observer for a process exit that handles
both crashing and regular cleanup.

tprrt/linux-stable,15c2d45d17418cc4a712608c78ff3b5f0583d83b,powerpc: Add 64bit optimised memcmp,"

I noticed ksm spending quite a lot of time in memcmp on a large
KVM box. The current memcmp loop is very unoptimised - byte at a
time compares with no loop unrolling. We can do much much better.

Optimise the loop in a few ways:

- Unroll the byte at a time loop

- For large (at least 32 byte) comparisons that are also 8 byte
  aligned, use an unrolled modulo scheduled loop using 8 byte
  loads. This is similar to our glibc memcmp.

A simple microbenchmark testing 10000000 iterations of an 8192 byte
memcmp was used to measure the performance:

baseline:	29.93 s

modified:	 1.70 s

Just over 17x faster.

v2: Incorporated some suggestions from Segher:

- Use andi. instead of rdlicl.

- Convert bdnzt eq, to bdnz. It's just duplicating the earlier compare
  and was a relic from a previous version.

- Don't use cr5, we have plans to use that CR field for fast local
  atomics.

For the devicetree case the ROM scripts are not available,
still the probe function should not block. The driver

tprrt/linux-stable,8f5c7579caba587a72ed91c7d76028efb8adb168,[POWERPC] Fix multiple bugs in rtas_ibm_suspend_me code,"

There are several issues with the rtas_ibm_suspend_me code, which
enables platform-assisted suspension of an LPAR as covered in PAPR
2.2.

1.) rtas_ibm_suspend_me uses on_each_cpu() to invoke
rtas_percpu_suspend_me on all cpus via IPI:

if (on_each_cpu(rtas_percpu_suspend_me, &data, 1, 0))
...

'data' is on the calling task's stack, but rtas_ibm_suspend_me takes
no measures to ensure that all instances of rtas_percpu_suspend_me are
finished accessing 'data' before returning.  This can result in the
IPI'd cpus accessing random stack data and getting stuck in H_JOIN.

This is addressed by using an atomic count of workers and a completion
on the stack.

2.) rtas_percpu_suspend_me is needlessly calling H_JOIN in a loop.
The only event that can cause a cpu to return from H_JOIN is an H_PROD
from another cpu or a NMI/system reset.  Each cpu need call H_JOIN
only once per suspend operation.

Remove the loop and the now unnecessary 'waiting' state variable.

3.) H_JOIN must be called with MSR[EE] off, but lazy interrupt
disabling may cause the caller of rtas_ibm_suspend_me to call H_JOIN
with it on; the local_irq_disable() in on_each_cpu() is not
sufficient.

Fix this by explicitly saving the MSR and clearing the EE bit before
calling H_JOIN.

4.) H_PROD is being called with the Linux logical cpu number as the
parameter, not the platform interrupt server value.  (It's also being
called for all possible cpus, which is harmless, but unnecessary.)

openstack/nova,26504d71ceaecf22f135d8321769db801290c405,Update migration defaults,"

In TripleO we wanted to enable live block migration. Pleasantly
surprising was finding that all it required was better options to
libvirt.

I'm told this works with the libvirt we gate on, though as we don't
gate migration yet, its hard to tell.

The limit should be ""PAGE_SIZE - len"" instead of PAGE_SIZE.  Also let's
use scnprintf() because snprintf() returns the number of bytes which
would have been printed if there were space and scnprintf() returns the
number of bytes actually printed.

I don't think we are ever going to actually hit this limit in real life.

Next step: find() redoes an awful lot of work finding each successive
match. Given the require modulus $mod and the number of elements to
discard $count, we now save the array of indices @nfm leading to the
*next found match*, and $lfm, the sum of the *least found match* greater
than the last one actually found.

Then, to find the next match:
- find $min = min(grep defined, {$mod}{$count}->{lfm})
- for each lfm not defined:
  - use the existing multiloop algorithm to find the next lfm
  - aborting if we cannot beat $min
  - but seed it with @nfm as the starting indices
  - and return @nfm as the starting indices of the first found match
    (if different)
  - and replace $min if $lfm is lower
- then delete the selected {$mod}{$count}->{lfm} and return it
- not forgetting to watch out for duplicate sums

Now finds a(5)=184 in 3.3s and a(6)=469 in 117.7s, and able to narrow
down the possibilities for a(7) to the range 1220-1251.

Add to sb->s_inodes list only if inode is not in I_CREATING state (meaning
that it wasn't allocated with new_inode(), which already does the

colinsc/koha,20fd03724aca67beb98b09dbf2275a81a1f8a3a7,Bug 7092 - Complete-subfield searches TraceCompleteSubfields syspref not working correctly,"

This patch adds a syspref UseICU for toggling between using """" and {} for
quoting in subject tracings. With normal Zebra indexing, """" must be used. With
ICU Zebra indexing, {} must be used.

This syspref interacts with TraceCompleteSubfields and TraceSubjectSubdivisions.

To test:

- marcflavour = MARC21
- make sure you have a record with a ""complex subject"", like
  ""Internet -- Law and legislation""

Toggle UseICU, TraceCompleteSubfields, and TraceSubjectSubdivisions and check
that you get the expected results for the clickable links in the OPAC detail
view:

TraceCompleteSubfields   = Don't force
TraceSubjectSubdivisions = Don't include
UseICU                   = Not using
  opac-search.pl?q=su:""Internet""
UseICU                   = Using
  opac-search.pl?q=su:{Internet}

TraceCompleteSubfields   = Force
TraceSubjectSubdivisions = Don't include
UseICU                   = Not using
  opac-search.pl?q=su,complete-subfield:""Internet""
UseICU                   = Using
  opac-search.pl?q=su,complete-subfield:{Internet}

TraceCompleteSubfields   = Don't force
TraceSubjectSubdivisions = Include
UsingICU                 = Not using
  opac-search.pl?q=(su:""Internet"") and (su:""Law and legislation."")
UsingICU                 = Using
  opac-search.pl?q=(su:{Internet}) and (su:{Law and legislation.})

TraceCompleteSubfields   = Force
TraceSubjectSubdivisions = Include
UseICU                   = Not using
  opac-search.pl?q=(su,complete-subfield:""Internet"") and (su,complete-subfield:""Law and legislation."")
UseICU                   = Using
  opac-search.pl?q=(su,complete-subfield:{Internet}) and (su,complete-subfield:{Law and legislation.})

Check that clicking on the generated links gives the expected search results,
but with normal and ICU indexing. (I have actually not tested this with ICU, so
doing that before signing off is crucial.)

UPDATE 2012-03-16:

Changed the name of the syspref from TracingQuotes to UseICU after a suggestion
from Paul P., to make it more generally useful.

I have used ""Using/Not using"" instead of ""Use/Don't use"" in the description of
the syspref, to reflect the fact that this syspref will not change how Zebra
does its indexing - it's just a way of telling Koha how the indexing is
actually done.

I have also set UseICU = 1 in updatedatabase.pl, since that will preserve the
current behaviour of Koha, but UseICU = 0 in sysprefs.sql, since most new
installations will not have ICU activated.

For AMDGPU, if an operand requires an SGPR but is only available as a
VGPR, a loop needs to be introduced to execute the instruction with
each unique combination of values across all lanes. The rest of the
instructions in the block will be moved to a new block following the
loop. Check if the next instruction's parent changed, and update the
iterators and insertion block if this happened.

Tests will be included in a future patch.

tprrt/linux-stable,68aee7ba66d390abf48c13791a84f6bce29d6f19,[SCSI] scsi_debug: fix invalid value check for guard module parameter,"

In the module initialization, invalid value for guard module parameter
is detected by the following check:

        if (scsi_debug_guard > 1) {
                printk(KERN_ERR ""scsi_debug_init: guard must be 0 or 1\n"");
                return -EINVAL;
        }

But this check isn't enough, because the type of scsi_debug_guard is
'int' and scsi_debug_guard could be a negative value.

This fixes it by changing the type of scsi_debug_guard to 'unsigned int'
instead of adding extra check for a negative value.

GNOME/meld,d6b0cdb4fe74f6a4d707da44f5b7d1dce2ea016d,Fix diffing of sub-directories in git repositories (bug 609025),"

Previously, running meld on a path located anywhere in a git repository
would result in meld displaying all modified files in the repository -
not just those files which are located under the path specified by the
user.  For example, if a git repository contained 3 modified files
layed out as follows:
 dir1/
	file1
 dir2/
	file2
 /file3

running ""meld ./"" from within dir1 would present the user with diffs
for file1, file2, and file3 even though the user only wanted to diff
the files in dir1.  Similarly, running ""git diff dir1"" from the root
of the repository would result in diffs for file1, file2, and file3
being displayed.

This change causes meld to behave in a more sane manner, similar to
its operation in subversion and CVS repositories.  Running ""git diff ./""
from within dir1 will now only show file1 as being modified, and
running ""git diff dir1"" from the root of the repository will similarly
show only file1 as being modified.

- 'M' was replaced with 'L' (meaning ""Left"", for the left-hand part of
  the message) in the definition of Adiantum hashing, to avoid confusion
  with the full message
- ε-almost-∆-universal is now abbreviated as ε-∆U instead of εA∆U
- ""block"" is now used only to mean block cipher and Poly1305 blocks

Also, Adiantum hashing was moved from the appendix to the main paper.

To avoid confusion, update relevant comments in the code to match.

GNOME/mutter,b6b9ac0b85da47874086899ea11770587b0686fb,Add a cogl-version header,"

This adds a version header which contains macros to define which
version of Cogl the application is being compiled against. This helps
applications that want to support multiple incompatible versions of
Cogl at compile time.

The macros are called COGL_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,MICRO}. This does not
match Clutter which names them CLUTTER_{MAJOR,MINOR,MICRO}_VERSION but
I think the former is nicer and it at least matches Cairo and Pango.

The values of the macro are defined to COGL_VERSION_*_INTERNAL which
is generated by the configure script into cogl-defines.h.

There is also a macro for the entire version as a string called
COGL_VERSION_STRING.

The internal utility macros for encoding a 3 part version number into
a single integer have been moved into the new header so they can be
used publicly as a convenient way to check if the version is within a
particular range. There is also a COGL_VERSION_CHECK macro for the
very common case that a feature will be used since a particular
version of Cogl. There is a macro called COGL_VERSION which contains
the pre-encoded version of Cogl being compiled against for
convenience.

Unlike in Clutter this patch does not add any runtime version
identification mechanism.

A test case is also added which just contains static asserts to sanity
check the macros.

Before the plethora of platforms gets any worse, establish a common
rule to invoke the wrapper for any platform.  Add arguments to
the rule for initrd, dts, dtb, etc.   Show example usage with initrd.

Create default rules for zImage, and zImage.initrd.  initrd targets
depend on the ramdisk file.

Don't consider targets for zImage.initrd that are targets for zImage.
This means uImage is no longer considered a target for zImage.initrd.

tprrt/linux-stable,2663218ba6e3dd6f27df9664e00fa3eb63be3a3f,ima: Simplify policy_func_show.,"

If the func_tokens array uses the same indices as enum ima_hooks,
policy_func_show can be a lot simpler, and the func_* enum becomes
unnecessary.

Also, if we use the same macro trick used by kernel_read_file_id_str we can
use one hooks list for both the enum and the string array, making sure they
are always in sync (suggested by Mimi Zohar).

Finally, by using the printf pattern for the function token directly
instead of using the pt macro we can simplify policy_func_show even further
and avoid needing a temporary buffer.

This patch adds support for custom S3 servers in the connection string.
It also adds explicit support for setting the server port, and whether
or not to use SSL, both as paramaters to the smart_open function as
well as within the connection string.

These changes are neccessary to be able to connect to s3proxy and
other custom s3 servers which don't run on the default port,
or neccessarily use SSL.

* Fix unit tests

* updated README.rst with new s3 mode.

* Added a new unit test for the unsecured calling form

* Updated style and unit test.

* Check that the port argument isnt normally passed.

* Add generic HTTP and HTTPS streaming support.

Adds support for opening vanilla HTTP and HTTPS addresses.
Supports efficient streaming, gzip and bz2 compression,
as well as Kerberos and username/password (basic) http
authentication.

* Clean up http unit tests.

* Cosmetic changes and doc updates.

* Re-use the open filehandle rather than open a new one.

This allows one to use any filehandle-like object instead of
just local posix. It also avoids unneccessary filesystem syscalls.

* merge artifact

* Add unit tests for compressed httpd reads.

This breaks out the http tests into their own test class.

Also fixed a few behaviors in the HttpReader uncovered by

Note to crash team: This CL is a refactor and has no intended behavior change.

This change was scripted by https://crbug.com/676387#c8.

... and then replaced by DCHECK_CURRENTLY_ON(UI) per request.

Which forced a fix to .../chromeos/printing/printers_manager_unittest.cc
as its TestBrowserThreadBundle was initialized too late for TestingProfile's
constructor (which would now crash in DCHECK_CURRENTLY_ON()), switched to
using proper member stack ordering instead of trying to do more or less
that but not quite correctly with heap allocations.

When triggering nic down, there is a time window between bringing down
the protocol stack and stopping the work task. If the net is up in the
time window, it may bring up the protocol stack again.

This patch fixes it by stop the work task at the beginning of
hns3_nic_net_stop(). To keep symmetrical, start the work task at the
end of hns3_nic_net_open().

Currently tools/build has access to all the kernel headers in

tools/build to erroneously include kernel headers when it should only
be including userspace-exported headers.

Unfortunately, mkcpustr still needs access to some of the asm kernel

chromium/chromium,9803c0eb2761892ad1e6826f80a1b3597d6cea67,[media] Fix video to canvas GPU-CPU race.,"

VideoFrames marked with VideoFrameMetadata::READ_LOCK_FENCES_ENABLED
must be retained until all reads have been completed. Such frames are
produced when software frames are uploaded to GpuMemoryBuffers. The
VideoResourceUpdater handles this, but PaintCanvasVideoRenderer
implemented only sync tokens.

As a result, WebGL reads of software-decoded frames can tear when the
storage is reused for later frames.

This CL adds a GL_COMMANDS_COMPLETED_CHROMIUM query after each potential
VideoFrame read in PaintCanvasVideoRenderer, and retains a reference to
the VideoFrame until it completes. This ensures that the memory is not
reused until after the reads complete in the GPU process.

If the user is going to call --run they're more likely interested in the
job ID than the executable ID. This change suppresses the executable ID
in that case, but in general, if there is a Makefile, ""dx build ...
--run"" will still spew out the output of the make process, making it
nontrivial to extract the job ID. So this isn't a general solution to
make the job ID easily available to the user, but it will at least fix
some simple tests.

(dx build --remote solves a similar problem by running the make step
separately from the upload step, so that the latter can be easily parsed
for the executable ID.)

This bug was exposed by changes made in 3f29d10. Previously it was
masked by the fact that we would print out the executable ID, then call
os.execv-- which transfers control without flushing buffers, so the
executable ID would never be seen by the user. The subprocess methods
do, however, flush the buffers and made the executable ID visible.

nwjs/chromium.src,e636eab5a532be27a3953409f3a3534bd976a4da,Revert of Create a Android Sync integration test for typed URLs (patchset #4 id:140001 of https://codereview.chromium.org/862113005/),"

Reason for revert:
This is breaking building chrome/android:chrome_sync_shell_test_apk
with gn due to a dependency to the autogenerated enum org.chromium.ui.base.PageTransition;

I am not sure why no bots failed when landing it (we don't seem to have gn builder upstream for android?) but reverting it locally makes it build again.

To repro: Reapply the patch and run
gn gen out/Release  --args='is_debug=false os=""android"" cpu_arch=""arm"" use_goma=true goma_dir=""/usr/local/google/clank/goma/goma""'

ninja -C out/Release -j 200  chrome/android:chrome_sync_shell_test_apk

tprrt/linux-stable,5850dd8f6d4e79484d498c0d77b223d1041f9954,[POWERPC] cell: hard disable interrupts in power_save(),"

With soft-disabled interrupts in power_save, we can
still get external exceptions on Cell, even if we are
in pause(0) a.k.a. sleep state.

When the CPU really wakes up through the 0x100 (system reset)
vector, while we have already started processing the 0x500
(external) exception, we get a panic in unrecoverable_exception()
because of the lost state.

This occurred in Systemsim for Cell, but as far as I can see,
it can theoretically occur on any machine that uses the
system reset exception to get out of sleep state.

Problem

Some references in the documentation ended up broken after rearrangements in
the example code, resulting in missing code blocks. The note at the beginning
of CHANGES was also unindented, resulting in part of it being rendered.

Certain numpy-array-like-things may not support all of the indexing
methods that numpy uses. When fusing getitem/getarray calls together, we
shouldn't pass ""fancy indexing"" requests to these backends. 

To solve this, `da.from_array` now takes the keyword `fancy=True` to
indicate whether the datastore supports ""fancy indexing"". If False, a new
function `getarray_nofancy` is used in the graph instead of `getarray`.
The default is True, keeping with current behavior. The rewrite pass won't
fuse indexing involving fancy indexing inside of calls to `getarray_nofancy`.

GNOME/mutter,26b061c3a80a81ec1fb19f61770ad4f6c3df40c1,clutter-backend-egl: Create a dummy X window and EGL surface,"

After the EGL context is created it now also creates an invisible 1x1
window and a corresponding surface so that the context can be
immediately made current. This is similar to changes for the GLX
backend introduced in d2c091e62.

It is only the X bit that it matters to copy from the standin to the largefile
in the working directory. While it generally doesn't do any harm to copy the
whole mode, it is also ""wrong"" to copy more than the X bit we care about. It
can make a difference if someone should try to handle largefiles differently,
such as marking them read-only.

Thus, do similar to what utils.setflags does and set the X bit where there are
R bits and obey umask.

rails/rails,0dde6ab960bb0be9627b224f40fbbe5eb5ad97c5,Optimize Module#delegate to no longer be linear,"

The previous implementation is pretty much linear.
Delegating 10 methods is 10 times slower than delegating 1 method.

```
     old_delegate(1)     27.299k (± 2.7%) i/s -    138.216k in   5.066863s
     old_delegate(2)     14.372k (± 2.5%) i/s -     72.879k in   5.074092s
     old_delegate(3)      9.434k (± 7.3%) i/s -     47.750k in   5.092412s
     old_delegate(4)      6.771k (±10.4%) i/s -     33.810k in   5.060218s
     old_delegate(5)      5.733k (± 4.4%) i/s -     28.861k in   5.044486s
```

Beside a few micro-optimizations, this patch mostly try to call `module_eval`
only once, because it has a significant fixed cost every time it's called.

By concatening the method definitions to together, we gain performance when
multiple methods are delegated at once:

```
     new_delegate(1)     28.531k (± 2.6%) i/s -    143.052k in   5.017356s
     new_delegate(2)     16.751k (± 2.4%) i/s -     85.072k in   5.081371s
     new_delegate(3)     12.021k (± 3.0%) i/s -     61.048k in   5.083224s
     new_delegate(4)      9.433k (± 3.1%) i/s -     47.944k in   5.087528s
     new_delegate(5)      7.745k (± 3.0%) i/s -     38.849k in   5.020850s
```

Which is respectively 5%, 16%, 27%, 39% and 35% improvements.

This is a global search-and-replace that replaces the Ruby 1.8 symbol
key hash rocket syntax to Ruby 1.9 syntax in

        app/controllers/{m,n,r,s,t}*.rb

Since this is a big change list, the style issues in the changed lines
are not being dealt with so that errors are minimized and code review
is easier. There is one exception though:

If the lines before the change have a good alignment of hash keys that
span multiple lines and the lines after the change do not (because the
change might alters the number of spaces needed for the alignment), then
the alignment is fixed, such that no new style issues are introduced. If
the alignment was not correct to begin with, then it is not fixed.

As a result, please ignore linter comments for this change.

a variable-length array, with one element for each port.  Therefore

psf/black,a4c11a75e12300abfbe4c36854e450d42bdd1ee7,Re-indent the contents of docstrings (#1053),"

* Re-indent the contents of docstrings when indentation changes

Keeping the contents of docstrings completely unchanged when
re-indenting (from 2-space intents to 4, for example) can cause
incorrect docstring indentation:

```
class MyClass:
  """"""Multiline
  class docstring
  """"""

  def method(self):
    """"""Multiline
    method docstring
    """"""
    pass
```
...becomes:
```
class MyClass:
    """"""Multiline
  class docstring
  """"""

    def method(self):
        """"""Multiline
    method docstring
    """"""
        pass
```

This uses the PEP 257 algorithm for determining docstring indentation,
and adjusts the contents of docstrings to match their new indentation
after `black` is applied.

A small normalization is necessary to `assert_equivalent` because the
trees are technically no longer precisely equivalent -- some constant
strings have changed.  When comparing two ASTs, whitespace after
newlines within constant strings is thus folded into a single space.

nwjs/chromium.src,fd525b8b047cf0843d05107567c14aea9a5858e0,Push the top margin of floats past all useless fragmentainers.,"

The top margin of a float is not to be split across fragmentainer boundaries if
it can be avoided. We had code to push the margin over to the next
fragmentainer if we were out of space, but we may actually have to push it all
the way to the next fragmentainer *group* (i.e column row) in some cases.

calculatePaginationStrutToFitContent() helps us get there. That's the method we
use to push oversize content (lines and unbreakable blocks) to a better place,
so let's use it for margins too.

Card cases is really tricky on the new website.
There are 2 kinds of page where we can find cards infomation
 - CardsPage: List some of the PSU cards
 - CardsComingPage: On the coming transaction page (for a specific checking account),
   we can find all cards related to this checking account. Information to reach this
   CC is in the home page

We have to go through this both kind of page for those reasons:
 - If there is no coming yet, the card will not be found in the home page and we will not
   be able to reach the CardsComingPage. But we can find it on CardsPage
 - Some cards are only on the CardsComingPage and not the CardsPage
 - In CardsPage, there are cards (with ""Business"" in the label) without checking account on the
   website (either history nor coming), so we skip them.
 - Some card on the CardsPage that have a checking account parent, but if we follow the link to
   reach it with CardsComingPage, we find an other card that not in CardsPage.

With constexpr you make it slightly easier for the compiler to
optimize code, though the effect will be small.

Also, with constexpr types the compiler becomes better at telling

ponylang/ponyc,7eca1b18b965d2797ca394ce0a13e35cf61cb5d8,Initial version of release packaging using COPR/PPA,"

This commit has the initial version of release packaging using
Fedora COPR and Ubuntu Launchpad PPA services.

The biggest limitation is that for Fedora COPR, the API tokens
expire every 180 days and need to be regenerated and updated
manually. This is annoying but not especially hard to do.

Additionally, for trusty build, the current implementation
disables building the pcre related tests in packages/stdlib
to avoid complexity related to libpcre2-dev not being
available there.

The current implementation only kicks off builds on COPR/PPA
for releases. The current implementation relies on downloading
the ""official"" snapshot tar.gz from github for the release
that matches the value in the VERSION file:
https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/archive/${VERSION}.tar.gz

This is to ensure we're always using the right source code
for a particular release.

In theory, it should be relatively easy/painless to expand
support to be able to do nightly snapshot builds. This url
would be the main thing that needs to change along with
deciding which version number to assign for a nightly
build.

The currently supported architecture is x86_64.

The currently supported distributions are:

* CentOS 7
* Fedora 26
* Fedora 27
* Fedora 28
* Fedora Rawhide
* OpenSuSE Leap 15 (default llvm; not 3.9)
* OpenSuse Tumbleweed (default llvm; not 3.9)
* Ubuntu Trusty (stdlib regex tests are disabled)
* Ubuntu Xenial
* Ubuntu Artful
* Ubuntu Bionic
* Ubuntu Cosmic

Fedora COPR also supports the Mageia distribution along with the
i386/i586/ppc64le architectures. ARM architecture support is in
the works and should become available in the near future.

Ubuntu Launchpad might support building for debian versions but
I haven't been able to confirm yet. It also supports ths following
architectures: i386/arm64/armhf/powerpc/ppc64el/s390x.

Future work could include expanding support for additional
architectures, additional distributions, and/or nightly snapshot
builds.

This change introduces an ""extra header"" section of a channel message
header. On windows, platform handles are place into this section instead
of being appended to the end of a message.

At the same time, make a couple of smaller changes:
1. Allow the number of serialised handles to be less than the number
stated in the constructor.
2. Add a has_mach_ports() helper function.
3. Limit the number of attached handles.

These changes are all prep work for Mach ports support.

This re-land perserves the old wire format and message semantics on ChromeOS
and changes it on all other platforms.

facebook/folly,173044e4ea34f4bd3fe927359f73c5649a02436f,Rework the Future::Core state machine,"

Summary:
There was a race reading `callback_` in `maybeCallback` and setting `callback_` in `setCallback`. This diff reworks the state machine to make this unpossible. To avoid the explosion of states due to the cross-product of has-interrupt-handler/has-been-interrupted/etc. I introduce a separate lock for setting interrupt handler and interruption, since this is primarily orthogonal. Other attributes (active, for example) are still atomic variables, and while somewhat tied into the state machine logically (e.g. transitioning from Armed to Done only happens when active) they are mostly independent, keeping the state machine simple (and probably faster).

I think it may even be possible to do some things cheaper. In some states, we may not need to protect the writing of `callback_` and `result_`. But we'd need to enforce some ordering so I'm not going to try to tackle that. But that could be some speedup if we can do it cheaply.

Test Plan:
Builds and all existing tests pass.

Taehee Yoo says:

====================
net: core: fix a lockdep splat in the dev_addr_list.

This patchset is to avoid lockdep splat.

When a stacked interface graph is changed, netif_addr_lock() is called
recursively and it internally calls spin_lock_nested().
The parameter of spin_lock_nested() is 'dev->lower_level',
this is called subclass.
The problem of 'dev->lower_level' is that while 'dev->lower_level' is
being used as a subclass of spin_lock_nested(), its value can be changed.
So, spin_lock_nested() would be called recursively with the same
subclass value, the lockdep understands a deadlock.
In order to avoid this, a new variable is needed and it is going to be
used as a parameter of spin_lock_nested().
The first and second patch is a preparation patch for the third patch.
In the third patch, the problem will be fixed.

The first patch is to add __netdev_upper_dev_unlink().
An existed netdev_upper_dev_unlink() is renamed to
__netdev_upper_dev_unlink(). and netdev_upper_dev_unlink()
is added as an wrapper of this function.

The second patch is to add the netdev_nested_priv structure.
netdev_walk_all_{ upper | lower }_dev() pass both private functions
and ""data"" pointer to handle their own things.
At this point, the data pointer type is void *.
In order to make it easier to expand common variables and functions,
this new netdev_nested_priv structure is added.

The third patch is to add a new variable 'nested_level'
into the net_device structure.
This variable will be used as a parameter of spin_lock_nested() of
dev->addr_list_lock.
Due to this variable, it can avoid lockdep splat.

tprrt/linux-stable,155cc6b784a959ed456fe46dca522e1d28b3b718,[XFS] Use atomics for iclog reference counting,"

Now that we update the log tail LSN less frequently on transaction
completion, we pass the contention straight to the global log state lock
(l_iclog_lock) during transaction completion.

We currently have to take this lock to decrement the iclog reference
count. there is a reference count on each iclog, so we need to take þhe
global lock for all refcount changes.

When large numbers of processes are all doing small trnasctions, the iclog
reference counts will be quite high, and the state change that absolutely
requires the l_iclog_lock is the except rather than the norm.

Change the reference counting on the iclogs to use atomic_inc/dec so that
we can use atomic_dec_and_lock during transaction completion and avoid the
need for grabbing the l_iclog_lock for every reference count decrement
except the one that matters - the last.

The object was to make it easier to follow, and to also remove fruit
spamming.
The attribute ""fruitsMax"" now denotes the maximum number of fruits in
the plant at any given time.
""fruitsChance"" now denotes a percentage, i.e. [0, 100]. The closer to
100 the greater the chance of a fruit being created or dropped each
tick.
The existing fruiting entities were also altered to make them produce
less fruits, to prevent spamming.

On some SoMs it was observed that occasionally the timestamps obtained from the
AudioTrack are suddenly consistently off from their expected value. This is
different from just normal timestamp jitter which evens out over time. The
result is errors flooding the logs due to the way we handle this currently.

While jumping timestamps is certainly indicative of a bug in the audio HAL
driver, we should still handle this better and simply resync to the new offset.

Bug: internal b/77654451
Test: Ran on several different SoMs, verfied proper behaviors.

tprrt/linux-stable,41ba50fd6cac084a93e7651c528ef4bc37996ee2,ath9k: do not miss longcal on AR9002,"

Each of AGC & I/Q calibrations can take a long time. Long calibration
and NF calibration in particular are forbiden for parallel run with
ADC & I/Q calibrations. So, the chip could not be ready to perform the
long calibration at the time of request. And a request to perform the
long calibration may be lost.

In order to fix this, preserve the long calibration request as a
calibration state flag and restore the long calibration request each
time the calibration function is called again (i.e. on each subsequent
ivocation of the short calibration).

This feature will be twice useful after the next change, which will
make it possible to start the long calibration before all ADCs & I/Q
calibrations are completed.

Run tested with AR9220.

This is a followup change for previous commit 0ba15075fc5f
(permit multiple pids attaching to the same probe).
That commit changes the event name for python uprobe API
in order to permit multiple processes attaching to the
same uprobe point. The C++ uprobe event name remains
unchanged and thus a descrepancy.

This patch add changes to C++ side and also make python uretprobe
having the same naming convention.

Originally I experimented to put the common code to generate
event names in libbpf.c. But doing this seems more klunky
than simplicity of C++ and Python. So I stick to the current
design.

No need to add pid to kprobe event names as kprobe bpf invocation
will ignore pid anyway.

tprrt/linux-stable,948c436e463d34e0d716aff0f333bb74471e5399,mm/page_alloc: fix and rework pfn handling in memmap_init_zone(),"

Let's update the pfn manually whenever we continue the loop.  This makes
the code easier to read but also less error prone (and we can directly fix
one issue).

When overlap_memmap_init() returns true, pfn is updated to
""memblock_region_memory_end_pfn(r)"".  So it already points at the *next*
pfn to process.  Incrementing the pfn another time is wrong, we might
leave one uninitialized.  I spotted this by inspecting the code, so I have
no idea if this is relevant in practise (with kernelcore=mirror).

facebook/buck,f785fe95cef209c14aa62722f888ee6b4f3fc1e6,Change FileSystemMap.ValueLoader to a PathFragment parameter,"

Summary:
LimitedFileHashCacheEngine takes the value passed in by FSM.ValueLoader and
stores it in the returned value. This would undo most of the memory savings
gained from using PathFragments.

Therefore, this diff changes FSM.ValueLoader to take a PathFragment, and have
implementations convert it to a path as necessary. For
LimitedFileHashCacheEngine, it simply stores this PathFragment instead of a
Path.

Test Plan:
Run builds using file_hash_cache_mode = limited_prefix_tree. Take memory
snapshot after a build and compare retained heap sizes.

The dialog tried to retain the current configuration mode. However,
doing so means that we end up in the wrong mode in some situation (e.g.
opening the dialog with two displays but only one enabled).

Fix this by always selecting a configuration mode. This potentially
switches the user from ""join"" to ""single"" if only one monitor is left.
However, the user has no way to do this manually, so no unexpected UI
change will happen.

Reason for revert:
https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=476544#c5

Original issue's description:
> Add DisplayScheduler for Surfaces
>
> This uses a SyntheticBeginFrameSource and a simple
> BeginFrame + deadline to determine when to draw.
>
> A simple heuristic based on recent activity is
> used to detect currently active surfaces that we
> want to wait for.
>
> Future patches will put this in charge of sending
> BeginFrames to surface produces, recovering
> producer latency, and replace the heuristic with
> something more correct.

The delete was executed previously based on database row

for every snippet.

This should be better since the database index is confusing
for example when snippets are deleted and added. This also
hides the underlying implementation better than before.

This adds XLIFF files with a few basic labels and a german translation.
This shows the principle and can be used as a base for a generic
label catalog to use in all FLOW3 applications.

openstack/nova,c4fadfd4d290f1083ab520aed920eeff552e15c4,use already loaded BDM in instance.<action>,"

In I18e7483ec9a484a660e1d306fdc0986e1d5f952b BDM was added to the instance
notifications. In general to add BDM to the payload an exta DB query is
needed. However in some places the BDM is already separately before the
notify_about_instance_action is called to send the notification. In this cases
loading the BDM again is unnecessary as the already loaded BDM can be reused.

This patch makes sure that notify_about_instance_action is called with the
already loaded BDM. There will be subsequent patches to do the same with
other notify calls.

snapcore/snapd,22309d38726fae26e17fd6a7c283ec25a7543e99,"overlord/snapstate, & fallout: give Install a *RevisionOptions","

This change is a pure refactor that drops `snapstate.InstallCohort`,
and changes the signature of `snapstate.Install` so it's more like
`snapstate.Update`, taking a `*snapstate.RevisionOptions`,

    func Install(st *state.State, name string, opts *RevisionOptions, userID int, flags Flags) (*state.TaskSet, error)

of course this also means changing InstallWithDeviceContext, in the
obvious way,

facebookexperimental/eden,5369643ef43889fbcf9989ee4f28cd7da343ad18,rust/futures: Add futures_ext::top_level_launch,"

Summary:
```
pub fn top_level_launch<F>(future: F) -> Result<F::Item, F::Error>
where
    F: Future + Send + 'static,
    F::Item: Send,
    F::Error: Send;
```

Starts the Tokio runtime using the supplied future to bootstrap the execution.

### Similar APIs

This function is equivalent to [`tokio::run`](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.22/tokio/fn.run.html) except that it also returns the future's resolved value as a Result. Thus it requires `F::Item: Send` and `F::Error: Send`.

This function has the same signature as [`Future::wait`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.28/futures/future/trait.Future.html#method.wait) which also goes from `F: Future` -> `Result<F::Item, F::Error>`, but `wait` requires an ambient futures runtime to already exist.

### Details

This function does the following:

- Start the Tokio runtime using a default configuration.
- Spawn the given future onto the thread pool.
- Block the current thread until the runtime shuts down.
- Send ownership of the future's resolved value back to the caller's thread.

Note that the function will not return immediately once the original future has completed. Instead it waits for the entire runtime to become idle.

### Panics

This function panics if called from the context of an executor.

The final call to zlib_deflate(Z_FINISH) may require more output
space to be allocated and so needs to re-invoked. Failure to do so in
the current code leads to incomplete zlib streams (albeit intact due to
the use of Z_SYNC_FLUSH) resulting in the occasional short object
capture.

Allow consumers to add a blob to a `TreeDefinition` by specifying only
the object ID and mode.  This lets users build tree entries without
having to create a `Blob` object (and thus load the object itself)
which is beneficial for users building trees with large objects.

This is only useful for Blobs, since they do not need to be fetched from
the object database to be realized within the tree builder.  Users are
not able to add Trees by ID, since we would need to load them (and
cannot, since we are not guaranteed to be instantiated within the
context of a repository).

When building with Xcode < 10.2, there's no need to inject /usr/lib/swift, since the OS will detect that the application was built with an old version of Xcode and is allowed to run with the bundled dylibs.

libvirt/libvirt,3502f791985b6d95327b57a32409b939f3d98e94,maint: update to latest gnulib,"

Time to update to new gnulib before a release.

gcc 5.1 introduced a new -Wformat-signedness, and new gnulib now
turns it on by default.  However, it is still rather lame at the
moment, because it warns for enums, even though there is no way
to control the signeness of an enum which does not use any members
that are negative or larger than INT_MAX, and even though such an
enum would always print the same for both %d and %u:
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66249

In file included from ../../src/util/virarch.c:26:0:
../../src/util/virarch.c: In function 'virArchFromHost':
../../src/util/virarch.c:180:15: error: format '%d' expects argument of type 'int', but argument 9 has type 'unsigned int' [-Werror=format=]
     VIR_DEBUG(""Mapped %s to %d (%s)"",

So this patch turns off the new warning as part of enabling all
other new gcc 5.1 warnings that gnulib now enables.

* .gnulib: Update to latest, in part for gcc 5.1 interaction.
* m4/virt-compile-warnings.m4: Ignore -Wformat-signedness, for now.

https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1601616

ERROR at //media/gpu/vaapi/vaapi_jpeg_decoder.cc:24:11: Can't include this header from here.

Linux Desktop lost vaapi_jpeg_encode_accelerator.cc:VaapiJpegEncodeAccelerator
as now it inherits from chromeos_camera::JpegEncodeAccelerator but hopefully
it can get back in later. The most important is the decoder and at least it is
still there.

lxc/lxc,c04f651ededff1d55081770686f57918763abb82,tests: enforce all methods for config items,"

This adds a test that checks LXC's configuration jump table whether all methods
for a given configuration item are implemented. If it is not, we'll error out.
This should provide additional safety since a) the API can now be sure that
dereferencing the pointer for a given method in the config struct is safe and
b) when users implement new configuration keys and forget to implement a
required method we'll see it right away.

* Refactor JetpackPlanDetails

Just happened to notice this component in an unrelated conversation and
saw it was missing out on some key Claypso principles so I refactored it
to try and simplify the component and bring it in line with our code
guidelines.

Major changes:
 - Stop calling analytics directly and instead dispatch Redux actions
 - Split apart the enhanced from the basic component
 - Wrap components in `connect()` and `localize()` for side effects and
   translation
 - Extract the function to get tracks data for early-abort instead of
   chained if/else structures
 - Prefer declarative style over mutating a `props` object when
   building the JSX.
 - Remove a bug where the tracks events could end up firing off a number
   of times on re-render when it should only fire once.

Currently there is a null pointer check for hdmi_phy that implies it
may be null, however a dev_err messages dereferences this potential null
pointer.  Avoid a null pointer dereference by only emitting the dev_err
message if hdmi_phy is non-null.  It is a moot point if the error message
needs to be printed at all, but since this is a relatively new piece of
code it may be useful to keep the message in for the moment in case there
are unforseen errors that need to be reported.

Ensure that no SMI interrupts occur between the read of the HPET & TSC
in the clock calibration loop.

I noticed that a 2.66GHz system incorrectly detected the processor
clock speed about 1/7 of the time:

	time.c: Detected 2660.005 MHz processor.	(most of the time)
	time.c: Detected 2988.203 MHz processor.	(sometime)

The problem is caused by an SMI interrupt occuring in hpet_calibrate_tsc()
between the read of the HPET & TSC. Prior to switching the BIOS into
ACPI mode, it appears that every 27msec an SMI interrupt occurs. The
SMI interrupt takes 4.8 msec to process.

Note: On my test system, TICK_MIN had to be >380. I picked 5000
to minimize risk of having a value that is too small for other
platforms.

twitter/util,31efdaf028dc5788821822680cf28924ed6a0524,util-app: Ensure flag parsing error reason is emitted before printing Flags#usage,"

Summary: Problem

Currently when flag parsing fails we attempt to concatenate the reason for the
failure (i.e., which flag input failed to be parsed) with the result of
`Flags#usage` which collects and prints all available flags to be set. The
issue is that collecting the flag usage can be an expensive operation in that
the code attempts to scan the entire classpath for all global flags. This can
fail in some situations (with an OOM) due to the application having a fairly
large classpath.

Solution

We want to ensure that users get the error reason before attempting to collect
and print all available flags of the system, thus we break out calling
`Flags#usage` from the error reason and delay the invocation until after we
have printed (and flushed) the error reason to System.err.

Note:

These changes do not attempt to solve the problem of an application running into
an OOM when `Flag#usage` fails due to a large classpath. It only attempts to
actually provide the useful error reason regardless of the OOM happening.

devices in its `attach` hook (`pc236_attach()`), it no longer has code

`pci_dev_get()` and `pci_dev_put()` can be removed.

failing tests when the user passes a command-line switch to
content_browsertests: --generate-accessibility-test-expectations

This lets us delete a bunch of empty expectations files and more easily
see at a glance which files are missing expectations for which tests.

pantsbuild/pants,73c6e7b253ed2a4fc73cafc92dda4e7778be1731,Fix _maybe_handle_help (#8945),"

## Problem

We were previously calling _maybe_handle_help within the with context provided by the streaming workunit handler. _maybe_handle_help checks to see if the user is trying to invoke ./pants goals and if so prints top-level goal help and calls _exiter, which calls sys.exit. This means that we were exiting the program within the with-context when the user ran ./pants goals, which meant that the with-context wasn't doing its job of shutting down the thread that polled for workunit information. So, if the user ran ./pants goals the program wouldn't cleanly exit but the workunit polling thread would stick around looping forever.

## Solution

Have _maybe_handle_help return a signal value rather than directly calling the exit function, and check for that signal value outside the with-context to determine if we even need to enter it. Also refactor some of the code that was in the with-context to make debugging a bit easier in the future.

This patch remove remoteDebuggingPort option. Instead, browser
is launched with '--remote-debugging-port=0' flag, letting browser
to pick any port. The puppeteer reads the port number from the
browser's stderr stream.

This change cuts average browser start time from 300ms to 250ms
on my machine. This happens since puppeteer doesn't have to probe
network once every 100ms, waiting for the remote debugging server to
instantiate.

The for loop in i40e_set_vsi_promisc() reports errors via dev_err() but
does not propagate the error up the call chain. Instead it continues the
loop and potentially overwrites the reported error value.
This results in the error being recorded in the log buffer, but the
caller might never know anything went the wrong way.

To avoid this situation i40e_set_vsi_promisc() needs to temporarily store
the error after reporting it. This is still not optimal as multiple
different errors may occur, so store the first error and hope that's
the main issue.

google/llvm-propeller,7f3e11e7c09e928baed4dced1f38a395b9f539dc,CodeGen: don't form illegail EXTLOAD operations.,"

It turns out that in most cases (the main exception being i1-related
types) once these operations are formed we cannot separate them and
the targets end up having to deal with them whether they want to or
not.

This is not a good situation, and a more reasonable default can be
formed by ackowledging this and having targets leave them as Legal.
Only x86 seems to be affected (other targets don't even try marking
the operation Expand).

Mostly there's no visible change here yet, but it will be useful to
have truly expanded EXTLOADS for MVT::f16 softening support.

Remove the need for calling TextFile.close() by making sure we

Since we generate the non existent username blindly, it can lead to Doctrine exceptions or any other exception.

We can catch all exceptions here but I guess it reduces the protection since the SQL query was not executed?

Alternative: we can only catch Doctrine DriverException (in addition to the existing AuthenticationException) and only silent the reported error codes?

When receiving a local ipv6 packet containing an l2tp packet not associated
with any session, l2tp node was handling the packet as if provided by an ipv6 feature,
hence crashing.

This patch fixes the issue by correctly dropping the packet instead.

This patch also fixes a typo from commit d65346098daf896.

wikimedia/integration-config,0dd246ad69d2aff1a065340036b03571f009451e,Constrain PyYAML<4,"

JJB 2.9.1 constrains PyYAML<4 but that is not properly taken in account
by pip/tox. Possibly due to us requiring PyYAML and Zuul requiring at
least 3.1.0.

Dont try to outsmart computer, and just set the same upper constraint
that is set in JJB 2.9.1.

That also remove a warning due to yaml.load(), which in turns causes the
zuul server layout validation to not output anything and cause
utils/zuul-layout-validate.sh to fail due to grep not matching anything.

Ignore grep exist status, it is only for filtering out the spammy zuul
DEBUG and INFO messages. We have set -o pipefail, thus the script would
still fail.

wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-PageTriage,35cddbe3e443048cb10bc48a700b8a4dd2eb7946,Update token handling for core API change,"

Core change I2793a3f2 changes API handling in a way that needs updates
to extensions for proper operation:
* needsToken() now returns a string
* Most custom token types are being replaced with a 'csrf' token (the
  former 'edit' token); any others need a new hook.
* All tokens must use a static salt. Compat with web UI using non-static
  tokens is supported and also serves to handle the now-deprecated token
  fetching.
* Documentation in getParamDescription() should return a string (not
  array) for 'token', as the signal to core that it should be replaced
  with a standardized message.

When compatibility with earlier versions of MediaWiki is no longer
maintained, the entry for 'token' from getAllowedParams() and
getParamDescription() may be removed, as may getTokenSalt(). This patch
leaves them in place.

Note this is intended to be compatible with earlier versions of
MediaWiki, and so should be safe to merge before the core change.

The goal
========
This is a working implementation of the 'automagic' that populates the
Cerebrum database with data not imported from authoritative systems. Data
like accounts, spreads, account affiliations and some group magic that
is needed by the Giske Indigo project.

Overview of the implementation
==============================

Current code
------------
The current implementation is a placeholder for a more dynamic set of
classes where config files will make up for a lot of the site spesific
code found in process_entity. The idea is that a set of basic tasks will
be implemented and controlled by some form of config directive. It is
implemented with a simple Factory.get() method to allow Mixins to override
current rules. The config file is currently only a few Mixin variables and
is in Python. The final language and syntax for this config file is TBD.

Both event based and batch handling
-----------------------------------
process_entity also implements both batch-like execution and future event
based execution. Today's batch running will only simulate an event like it
is received from an event handler. The goal with this implementation is to
be able to replace slow, seldom run batch jobs with faster, more complex
listeners or event handlers. Most of the code in process_entity is handling
an unknown entity where only the entity_type is known. This creates a
little overhead when running it as a batch job, but makes the code
portable.

The future
==========
process_entity needs a lot of work to be able to work as a generic ""Black
Box"" processor. The design is decent as it is, but a lot of the really
gritty config details are missing. There are plans to use this in other
Cerebrum projects so some cleanup and extension are expected shortly.
It is not expected to take over as the processor for the larger Cerebrum
instances like UiO since the ruleset will be near impossible to implement.
It is expected to take over for most other smaller instances, since a
common source base is A Nice Thing To Have(tm).

relying on worklet console log which might be racy on main. Using
computed style is better and more compatible.

spotify/luigi,0a63cc0a360a4b7dfcb0203d4a41719373a292da,Add metadata columns to the RDBMS contrib (#2440),"

* Add metadata column feature to Redshift

The goal of this feature is to allow metadata column to exists for
specific tables created by the Redshift contrib related tasks.

Given the scenario where we would always have to have a `created_tz`
column at the end of every tables generated by that contrib we could do
the following:

```python
UpdateTableTask(redshift.S3CopyToTable):

    def metadata_columns(self):
        return [('created_tz', 'TIMESTAMP')]

    def post_queries(self):
        return query = 'UPDATE {0} ' \
                       'SET created_tz = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ' \
                       'WHERE created_tz IS NULL'.format(self.table)
```

Adding layer of abstraction over this feature, you could easily
add many default behavior for specific tables for versioning the table
and more.

This feature is opt-in by default since we don't want this break other
people's pipeline after integrating this.

* Move the Metadata Columns implementation to the RDBMS

As suggested in the code-review, there are multiple other DBs that could
benefit from this change. Currently, only PSQL and Redshift implements
RDMS but other may implement this class and inherits that new behavior.

* Add tests for the Metadata behaviors

We've been internally using this feature for Redshift but moving this to
the RDBMS contrib and adding this behavior to PSQL could have unexpected
side effects, this takes care of testing if the feature works correctly
under Redshift and PSQL.

* Add additional documentation on how to use the new mixin

* Raise ValueError on invalid metadata_columns for RDBMS

If the count of metadata_columns is 0 and we're expecting to add them to
the table, then we raise an error because that is an invalid flow.

The contributor is required to have metadata_columns values if we want
to add that column to the table.

We've observed hangs of Bazel on shutdown with thread stacks indicating
that the cli-update-thread does not exit properly. We don't know why
this is happening, and have no easy way to reproduce.

My best guess is that the interrupt is swallowed somewhere, although I
was unable to pinpoint a specific place where that could happen. As a
defensive mechanism, this change adds a boolean flag that signals to the
CLI thread to shutdown in case the interrupt signal gets lost. This also
helps with a potential race between startUpdateThread and
stopUpdateThread.

Possible fix for #8432.

Previously, the documentation linked to Golang's source code, which
can drift from the list of cipher suites supported by Consul. Consul
has a hard-coded mapping of string values to Golang cipher suites, so
this is a more direct source of truth to help users understand which
string values are accepted in the `tls_cipher_suites` configuration

terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google,a29a0cbbdaddf4d9e9ca96baacdc2e3a34499907,Make licenses field of images computed.,"

Images now have a licenses field, which lets users specify licenses to
use on an image. But official images already have licenses on them, adn
so Terraform is reading those as a diff. To preserve backwards
compatiblity and avoid a breaking change that would require all
`google_compute_image` users to update their configs, I've set the field
to computed. This means that if no licenses are set in the config, there
can be licenses in the config without prompting a diff. Obviously, this
isn't ideal, as it means you can't ever remove all the licenses from an
image, but I think the benefits here outweigh the drawbacks.

Changes from V1 to V2 of this patch
- I had reversed the logic thinking that icmp type 0 is a echo
request,but it's reply -- needed to reverse the logic
- Found that ebtables takes the --ip-tos argument only as a hex number

This patch enables the skipping of some of the ICMP traffic rules on the
iptables level under certain circumstances so that the following filter
properly enables unidirectional pings:

<filter name='testcase'>
    <uuid>d6b1a2af-def6-2898-9f8d-4a74e3c39558</uuid>
    <!-- allow incoming ICMP Echo Request -->

    <!-- allow outgoing ICMP Echo Reply -->
    <rule action='accept' direction='out' priority='500'>
        <icmp type='0'/>
    </rule>

coreboot/coreboot,3707fc2d961720152e7e96bc1606b893023cb577,google/gru & kevin: Update DRAM configuration,"

We need to enable DRAM ODT on kevin/gru board to improve the
DRAM signal. Note, if the DRAM ODT is enabled and set to 120ohms,
the sdram VREF need to adjust to 840mv.

This patch also makes following changes:
1. For compatiblity with the  old board, add the
""sdram-lpddr3-hynix-4GB-666-no-odt.inc"" and
""sdram-lpddr3-hynix-4GB-800-no-odt.inc"" files
which do not enable sdram ODT.
2. Delete the 300MHz dram inc file. The 300MHz sdram config just
reduced 666MHz to 300MHz based on the 666MHz config file, and it is
not stable, so delete it.
3. Delete the 928MHz dram inc file, 928MHz sdram config still in
debuging, delete it for now.

tprrt/linux-stable,11a27e2121a544cae2dde62df9218b3d5d888a02,iw_cxgb4: complete the cached SRQ buffers,"

If TP fetches an SRQ buffer but ends up not using it before the connection
is aborted, then it passes the index of that SRQ buffer to the host in
ABORT_REQ_RSS or ABORT_RPL CPL message.

But, if the srqidx field is zero in the received ABORT_RPL or
ABORT_REQ_RSS CPL, then we need to read the tcb.rq_start field to see if
it really did have an RQE cached. This works around a case where HW does
not include the srqidx in the ABORT_RPL/ABORT_REQ_RSS CPL.

The final value of rq_start is the one present in TCB with the
TF_RX_PDU_OUT bit cleared. So, we need to read the TCB, examine the
TF_RX_PDU_OUT (bit 49 of t_flags) in order to determine if there's a rx
PDU feedback event pending.

Preserve the order of the elements that are not part of a case nor default in
a ng-switch directive

BREAKING CHANGE: elements not in the ng-switch were rendered after the
    ng-switch elements.  Now they are rendered in-place.

    Ng-switch directives should be updated with non ng-switch elements
    in render-order.  e.g.

    The following was previously rendered with <li>1</li> after ""2"":

    <ul ng-switch=""select"">
        <li>1</li>
        <li ng-switch-when=""option"">2</li>
    </ul>

    To keep the old behaviour, say:

    <ul ng-switch=""select"">
        <li ng-switch-when=""1"">2</li>
        <li>1</li>

Update the MachineClass for both Old World and New World Macs so that the

This part of Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) patch series focuses on KVM
changes required to create and manage SEV guests.

SEV is an extension to the AMD-V architecture which supports running encrypted
virtual machine (VMs) under the control of a hypervisor. Encrypted VMs have their
pages (code and data) secured such that only the guest itself has access to
unencrypted version. Each encrypted VM is associated with a unique encryption key;
if its data is accessed to a different entity using a different key the encrypted
guest's data will be incorrectly decrypted, leading to unintelligible data.
This security model ensures that hypervisor will no longer able to inspect or
alter any guest code or data.

The key management of this feature is handled by a separate processor known as
the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP) which is present on AMD SOCs. The SEV Key
Management Specification (see below) provides a set of commands which can be
used by hypervisor to load virtual machine keys through the AMD-SP driver.

The patch series adds a new ioctl in KVM driver (KVM_MEMORY_ENCRYPT_OP). The
ioctl will be used by qemu to issue SEV guest-specific commands defined in Key
Management Specification.

tprrt/linux-stable,babc250e278eac7b0e671bdaedf833759b43bb78,udlfb: introduce a rendering mutex,"

Rendering calls may be done simultaneously from the workqueue,
dlfb_ops_write, dlfb_ops_ioctl, dlfb_ops_set_par and dlfb_dpy_deferred_io.
The code is robust enough so that it won't crash on concurrent rendering.

However, concurrent rendering may cause display corruption if the same
pixel is simultaneously being rendered. In order to avoid this corruption,
this patch adds a mutex around the rendering calls.

tprrt/linux-stable,f34d9d2dcb7f17b64124841345b23adc0843e7a5,uml: network interface hotplug error handling,"

This fixes a number of problems associated with network interface hotplug.

The userspace initialization function can fail in some cases, but the
failure was never passed back to eth_configure, which proceeded with the
configuration.  This results in a zombie device that is present, but can't
work.  This is fixed by allowing the initialization routines to return an
error, which is checked, and the configuration aborted on failure.

eth_configure failed to check for many failures.  Even when it did check,
it didn't undo whatever initializations has already happened, so a present,
but partially initialized and non-working device could result.  It now
checks everything that can fail, and bails out, undoing whatever had been
done.

The return value of eth_configure was always ignored, so it is now just
void.

nwjs/chromium.src,a7d9c91779db25af17f983342ee7434e8b043579,Apply outline-offset on all edges (not just top/left),"

In InlinePainter::paintOutlineForLine, the ""outline rectangles"" are
formed by expanding and shifting by outline-offset. This however only
result in an offset of the outline on the top and left sides.
Rewrite the code to use an inflate() operation instead, so that all
four edges are affected by the offset.
The spec describes the effect of the 'outline-offset' property as:

  ""If the computed value of outline-offset is anything other than 0,
   then the outline is outset from the border edge by that amount.""
  ""Negative values must cause the outline to shrink into the border
   box.""

(http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-ui-3/#outline-offset)

This is also what ObjectPainter::paintOutline does.

This makes us match Gecko more closely rendering-wise.

Scsi_cmnd is an unsuitable argument for eh_device_reset_handler(),
eh_target_reset_handler(), and eh_host_reset_handler() which do not have
the scope of one single SCSI command.  These callbacks tend to use
fc_block_scsi_eh() requiring scsi_cmnd.  In order to start decoupling
above eh callbacks from scsi_cmnd, introduce a new variant of the
function called fc_block_rport() taking an fc_rport as argument.
Refactor the old fc_block_scsi_eh() to simply delegate to
fc_block_rport().

strapdata/elassandra,059d9f757a7d0fbb07ee13a60c0296fa435637c1,Docs: bad text wrapping,"

On the page http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-synonym-tokenfilter.html

even on a huge monitor the text is being wrapped the next way
```
mapping:
ipod, i-pod, i pod => ipod, i-pod, i pod
mapping:
ipod, i-pod, i pod => ipod
```

So one can think that ""mapping:"" is not in comment and is a part of syntax. But the lines are less than 80 chars, so perhaps the problem is in the page layout and there may be some other pages in the reference where the text is also being wrapped in an undesirable way.

This commit fixes these regressions:

 FAIL: gdb.base/maint.exp: mt set per on for expand-symtabs
 FAIL: gdb.base/maint.exp: maint set per-command on

caused by commit 1e3b796d58ac (""Change command stats reporting to use
class"").

gdb.log shows that the command stats are now printing garbage:

 (gdb) mt set per on
 Command execution time: -6.-419590 (cpu), 1467139648.-7706296840 (wall)
 Space used: 9809920 (-33276528 for this command)
 (gdb) FAIL: gdb.base/maint.exp: mt set per on for expand-symtabs

while there should have been no output at all.

The stats printing is done from within the scoped_command_stats's
destructor, depending on whether some flags in the object are set.
The problem is simply that scoped_command_stats's ctor misses clearing
those flags on some paths.

Since scoped_command_stats objects are allocated on the stack, whether
you'll see the regression simply depends on whatever happens to
already be on the stack space the object occupies.

audit_remove_watch_rule() drops watch's reference to parent but then
continues to work with it. That is not safe as parent can get freed once
we drop our reference. The following is a trivial reproducer:

mount -o loop image /mnt
touch /mnt/file
auditctl -w /mnt/file -p wax
umount /mnt
auditctl -D

Grab our own reference in audit_remove_watch_rule() earlier to make sure
mark does not get freed under us.

Not a fully blown gemfs, just our very own tmpfs kernel mount. Doing so
moves us away from the shmemfs shm_mnt, and gives us the much needed
flexibility to do things like set our own mount options, namely huge=
which should allow us to enable the use of transparent-huge-pages for
our shmem backed objects.

v2: various improvements suggested by Joonas

v3: move gemfs instance to i915.mm and simplify now that we have
file_setup_with_mnt

v4: fallback to tmpfs shm_mnt upon failure to setup gemfs

v5: make tmpfs fallback kinder

v5: better gemfs failure message

tensorflow/tensorflow,ef2246a879b08853d2bbc3601e0f6c4a8c09091f,Introduce affine terminator,"

Due to legacy reasons (ML/CFG function separation), regions in affine control
flow operations require contained blocks not to have terminators.  This is
inconsistent with the notion of the block and may complicate code motion
between regions of affine control operations and other regions.

Introduce `affine.terminator`, a special terminator operation that must be used
to terminate blocks inside affine operations and transfers the control back to
he region enclosing the affine operation.  For brevity and readability reasons,
allow `affine.for` and `affine.if` to omit the `affine.terminator` in their
regions when using custom printing and parsing format.  The custom parser
injects the `affine.terminator` if it is missing so as to always have it
present in constructed operations.

Update transformations to account for the presence of terminator.  In
particular, most code motion transformation between loops should leave the
terminator in place, and code motion between loops and non-affine blocks should
drop the terminator.

Stopping the event propagation prevent the user to watch for the event at an higher level. If it was needed to prevent a duplicate behavior in a component, others methods should be used like debouncing the event.

Changes:
- Save and check for `event.zfIsKeyHandled` in Keyboard utility to prevent to handle twice the same event in different components.
- Remove `event.stopPropagation` from components' keyboard handlers (Accordion, DropdownMenu, OffCanvas and Tabs).

autotools-mirror/automake,c348cde4decb1f22a2305742cadafcaf0dd70d63,tests: avoid extra test generation (for `instspc' tests),"

We don't really need to generate tons and tons of wrapper test
scripts (presently, ~ 90) just to run what is basically a single
test (specifically, `instspc-tests.sh') with different parameters.
In fact, the possibility of running a single driver script with
multiple files/configurations/parameters is one of the major
selling points of the 'parallel-tests' testsuite driver of
automake.  So why not use ourselves more extensively the best
features we provide?

* tests/instspc-tests.sh: Update heading comments.  Expect
to be executed, not sourced.  Update handling of command-line
arguments.  Adjust to reflect the renaming of ""instspc tests""
from `instspc-*.test' to `*.instspc'.
* tests/instspc-data.test: Update heading comments.  Execute
driver script `instspc-tests.sh', instead of sourcing it.
Give more informative messages in case of internal errors.
* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_EXTENSIONS): Define explicitly (to
`.test' and `.instspc').
(TESTS): Add `$(instspc_tests)'.
(generated_tests): Remove `$(instspc_tests)'.
(INSTSPC_LOG_COMPILER): Define.  Calls `instspc-tests.sh', so
that the ""instspc tests"" will be now executed by passing that
driver script a proper parameter.
($(instspc_tests)): Remove, we don't need anymore to generate
this tests.
($(instspc_tests:.test=.log)): Remove, substituted by ...
($(instspc_tests:.instspc=.log)): ... this.
($(instspc_tests)): New dependency declaration (dummy, but
required in order to have make actually produce expected log
files from the `.instspc.log' suffix rule).
(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES, generated_tests): Don't extend with
$(instspc_tests) anymore.
Update comments.

means we can't use the ansible_distribution_major_version fact to detect
whether we are building CentOS 7 or 8 images. Due to this, all CentOS
images (including CentOS 7) are currently published with a
'master-centos8' tag.

This change fixes the issue by using the base_tag variable which is
defined for CentOS 8 build jobs.

tprrt/linux-stable,1fdd08bedc56d2a927c5f230e2d63f17ca1068f1,bpf: add documentation for eBPF helpers (23-32),"

Add documentation for eBPF helper functions to bpf.h user header file.
This documentation can be parsed with the Python script provided in
another commit of the patch series, in order to provide a RST document
that can later be converted into a man page.

The objective is to make the documentation easily understandable and
accessible to all eBPF developers, including beginners.

This patch contains descriptions for the following helper functions, all
written by Daniel:

- bpf_get_prandom_u32()
- bpf_get_smp_processor_id()
- bpf_get_cgroup_classid()
- bpf_get_route_realm()
- bpf_skb_load_bytes()
- bpf_csum_diff()
- bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt()
- bpf_skb_set_tunnel_opt()
- bpf_skb_change_proto()
- bpf_skb_change_type()

v4:
- bpf_get_prandom_u32(): Warn that the prng is not cryptographically
  secure.
- bpf_get_smp_processor_id(): Fix a typo (case).
- bpf_get_cgroup_classid(): Clarify description. Add notes on the helper
  being limited to cgroup v1, and to egress path.
- bpf_get_route_realm(): Add comparison with bpf_get_cgroup_classid().
  Add a note about usage with TC and advantage of clsact. Fix a typo in
  return value (""sdb"" instead of ""skb"").
- bpf_skb_load_bytes(): Make explicit loading large data loads it to the
  eBPF stack.
- bpf_csum_diff(): Add a note on seed that can be cascaded. Link to
  bpf_l3|l4_csum_replace().
- bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt(): Add a note about usage with ""collect
  metadata"" mode, and example of this with Geneve.
- bpf_skb_set_tunnel_opt(): Add a link to bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt()
  description.
- bpf_skb_change_proto(): Mention that the main use case is NAT64.
  Clarify comment about invalidated verifier checks.

v3:
- bpf_get_prandom_u32(): Fix helper name :(. Add description, including
  a note on the internal random state.
- bpf_get_smp_processor_id(): Add description, including a note on the
  processor id remaining stable during program run.
- bpf_get_cgroup_classid(): State that CONFIG_CGROUP_NET_CLASSID is
  required to use the helper. Add a reference to related documentation.
  State that placing a task in net_cls controller disables cgroup-bpf.
- bpf_get_route_realm(): State that CONFIG_CGROUP_NET_CLASSID is
  required to use this helper.
- bpf_skb_load_bytes(): Fix comment on current use cases for the helper.

GNOME/mutter,7630d22b8d791cf2718e1018b2bffcd672fa3cfa,Add increased robustness for dealing with all workspaces windows and MRU,"

2003-12-13  Rob Adams  <readams@readams.net>

	Add increased robustness for dealing with all workspaces windows
	and MRU lists.
	Also add very preliminary _NET_WM_USER_TIME
	support, limited to simply listening for the property and keeping
	an internal variable updated, and also treating some input events
	as though they were user time updates.

	* src/window.c (meta_window_new_with_attrs): set on_all_workspaces
	in all cases _before_ adding to the workspaces, so that windows
	initially on all workspaces are added correctly to the MRU lists.
	Fix for #120907.
	(process_property_notify): add net_wm_user_time support.

	* src/workspace.c (meta_workspace_add_window): handle sticky
	windows so that we add to add mru lists if needed
	(meta_workspace_remove_window): handle sticky windows so that they
	are removed from all mru lists if needed.

	* src/display.[ch] (meta_display_open): add net_wm_user_time support.
	(event_callback): simulate user time update on key and button presses.

	* src/screen.c (set_supported_hint): add net_wm_user_time support.

	* src/window-props.c (init_net_wm_user_time): new function for
	user_time support
	(reload_net_wm_user_time): new function for user_time support
	(meta_display_init_window_prop_hooks): add hook for user_time

any necessary functions for consumption by the app. This also brings the

mbedmicro/mbed,be0bab3f4010b7add7181b83c9c0f39363e807c4,Only link in LPC17xx ethernet ISR as needed,"

Originally the ethernet ISR would be linked in to all mbed-os based
firmware because it was named ENET_IRQHandler() so that it would be
automatically placed in the FLASH image's interrupt vector table. This
meant that programs which made no use of the lwIP stack still pulled in
this ISR.

This commit changes the name of the routine so that the ISR isn't
automatically placed in the interrupt vector table at link time but is
instead dynamically placed in the interrupt vector table at runtime
when the lwIP stack is initialized. Now the ethernet ISR is only linked
in when it is actually needed.

Example arm-none-eabi-size output for a simple LED blinking program
showing the before and after size results:

Summary:
sh_binary rule creates symlinks of each resource in a new directory under the target's gen path.  The absolute path of the symlink directory structure, as resolved at runtime, is exported as *$BUCK_RUNTIME_RESOURCES* in the sh script's environment.

The structure of the symlink paths follow the conventions below:
| Resource Type | Linked Path |
| -- | -- |
|Build target resources (same cell) |$BUCK_RUNTIME_RESOURCES/__default__/*{target}*|
|Build target resources (different cell)|$BUCK_RUNTIME_RESOURCES/__external__/*{cell}*/*{target}*|
|Path resources (sh_binary rule)|$BUCK_RUNTIME_RESOURCES/__default__/*{relative resource path}*|

If sh_binary detects that conflicting path links would be generated, it fails the build.

are added where at least one uses a VxHS that doesn't require TLS
credentials and thus sets the domain disk source attribute ""tls = 'no'"".

Update the hotplug to be able to handle processing the tlsAlias whether
it's to add the TLS object when hotplugging a disk or to remove the TLS
object when hot unplugging a disk.  The hot plug/unplug code is largely
generic, but the addition code does make the VXHS specific checks only
because it needs to grab the correct config directory and generate the
object as the command line would do.

twitter/finatra,dac75ac3bd2a80f03d78e1cd2508023c0a28376c,finatra-kafka|streams: Add CSL to owners,"

**Problem**
CSL is not listed as an owner/watcher for the finatra/kafka and finatra/kafka-streams libraries,
so they cannot quickly make changes to them.

**Solution**
Add CSL as an owner of these libraries.

**Result**
CSL can quickly make changes to these libraries.

The collision detection code was removed in commit a0a155884ef66ca
as the cleanup was happening because the previous code was closely
tied to the user interface components.

Because that code wasn't appliable to the new listbox UI, it was
temporarily removed.

This patch re-adds this feature to work with the new code orgazination.

It makes no sense to hardcode the I2C bus into the codec_name field.

cpu_dai_name and platform_name are also overwritten later in

So remove the three fields, as mxs platform is dt-only platform.

The function that checks whether a key exists in an index failed

Deleting a record from an object store must also delete its exists

This is not totally straightforward: Since setup can install Cygwin with
either bitness (using the '--arch 32|64' option), we must do the right
thing if this is a 64-bit installer being used to install 32-bit Cygwin,
which will run under WoW, even if the installer isn't...

(Naming things like this makes things consistent with Cygwin-X, which
already names it's Start Menu folder 'Cygwin-X (32-bit)' on WoW64. It
also ensures that there aren't collisions between any setup created
shortcuts for 32-bit and 64-bits.)

The desktop icon is already named 'Cygwin Terminal' or 'Cygwin64
Terminal' so doesn't need attention.

Start menu links made in the 'Cygwin' folder by cygwin-doc, and possibly
other packages will also need adjusting.

encukou/freeipa,911992b8bf33b40f650ec406444ca8b9b847b54e,ipa-adtrust-install: run remote configuration for new agents,"

When ipa-adtrust-install is run, the tool detects masters that are
not enabled as trust agents and propose to configure them. With the
current code, the Schema Compat plugin is not enabled on these new
trust agents and a manual restart of LDAP server + SSSD is required.

With this commit, ipa-adtrust-install now calls remote code on the new
agents through JSON RPC api, in order to configure the missing parts.
On the remote agent, the command is using DBus and oddjob to launch
a new command,
/usr/libexec/ipa/oddjob/org.freeipa.server.trust-enable-agent [--enable-compat]
This command configures the Schema Compat plugin if --enable-compat is
provided, then restarts LDAP server and SSSD.

If the remote agent is an older version and does not support remote
enablement, or if the remote server is not responding, the tool
ipa-adtrust-install prints a WARNING explaining the steps that need
to be manually executed in order to complete the installation, and
exits successfully (keeping the current behavior).

The problem is that the logic which checks if a pointer is
valid relies on a poor heuristic based on the start and end
addresses of the data segment and heap.

Apart from miscalculating the heap bounds, this approach also
suffers from the fact that memory can come from places other
than the heap. See Bug#58528 for a more detailed explanation.

On Linux, the solution is to access the process's memory
through /proc/self/task/<tid>/mem, which allows for retrieving
the contents of pages within the virtual address space of
the calling process. If a address range is not mapped, a
input/output error is returned.

client/mysqltest.cc:
  Use new interface to my_safe_print_str.
include/my_stacktrace.h:
  Drop name from my_safe_print_str.
mysys/stacktrace.c:
  Access the process's memory through a file descriptor and
  dump the contents of the memory range. The file descriptor
  offset is equivalent to a offset into the address space.
  
  Do not print the name of the variable associated with the
  address. It can be better accomplished at a higher level.
sql/mysqld.cc:
  Put the variable dumping information within its own newline block.
  Use symbolic names which better convey information to the user.

(NEEDS REVIEW) confinement 'classic' not allowed. If your snap needs classic confinement to function, please make a request for this snap to use classic by creating a new topic in the forum using the 'store-requests' category and detail the technical reasons why classic is required.
```

Since snapcraft doesn't know if the snap has already been approved,
allow classic during local review, and let the the store can return
the error from the upload's automatic review, which snapcraft will
handle gracefully.

Commit 681cc5cd3efbeafca6386114070e0bfb5012e249 (""iommu sg merging:
swiotlb: respect the segment boundary limits"") introduced two
possibilities for entering an endless loop in lib/swiotlb.c:

 - if max_slots is zero (possible if mask is ~0UL)
 - if the number of slots requested fits into a swiotlb segment, but is
   too large for the part of a segment which remains after considering
   offset_slots

This fixes them

[CssSelector] Optimize regexs matching simple selectors

These shortcut parsers are applied first when converting a CSS selector to XPath, to be faster for simple selectors (tag matching, class matching with an optional tag, id matching with an optional tag).
None of the regexes defined here could have more chances to match more element when backtracking identifiers. So the backtracking is only slowing down the regex engine when the regex does not match (i.e. for any more complex selector for instance, or even for simple selectors without namespace of without tag name). Making quantifiers possessive solves this issue.

I also turned some capturing groups (around the namespace and the namespace delimiter) into non-capturing groups as we don't care about them in the output (they are just here to be optional).

AC_FUNC_MALLOC will define malloc to rpl_malloc in case libc is not the
Gnu one. Since most probable replacements (uClibc, musl) are behaving
the same regarding the malloc(0) case and glslsandbox-player is not really
dependant on this case, we can safely just check the presence of the malloc()
function.

Since there are currently a lot of error coded returning 1, that mean
completly different thing, i guess it would be very nice to change this.
A client should not be forced to parse the error message, the error code
should be enough to explain the error.

This change suggests some error codes, that have a hierarchical

error codes actually used with -.

In V1 we received complaints that Renderer was too locked down.
In particular, it wasn't possible to implement a Renderer that
wrapped another Renderer, since most of the methods were package
private and final (e.g. enable).

This change defines Renderer as a proper interface, removing
this limitation. A method-reordering-only change will follow
this one, to get things into a nice consistent/sane order in
each of the Renderer classes.

billbrod/spatial-frequency-preferences,6fe1d7019dd5b18c8e5ce9e2fc9ff43e41f514f4,updates first_level_analysis for BIDS,"

with this commit, the main thing we do is update first_level_analysis.py
so it works for BIDS-structured data (note that this still needs more
testing). part of that is updating first_level_analysis.py, stimuli.py,
and utils.py so that they can handle the multiple stimuli types we
have (logpolar, constant, and pilot)

 - first_level_analysis no longer needs to import h5py or
   design_matrices, since we get all the info we need right from the
   stimulus dataframe. this means that design_df has been replaced by
   stim_df (with some extra pre-processing) throughout the file

 - sfp.stimuli is imported as sfp_stimuli, to avoid name conflicts with
   the variable stimuli

 - some updates to how we expect the results surfaces to be stored:
   switches order of results_template_path's results name and
   hemisphere; the various models_class surface files are no longer in a
   separate folder

 - we have two separate freq_identifier functions (for determining
   stimulus superclass), one for the constant and for the logpolar /
   pilot stimuli.

 - calculate_stim_local_sf (and the function that calls it,
   _add_local_sf_to_df) can now handle different stim_types. this is not
   a major change.

 - renamed create_GLM_result_df to main, since we don't really need the
   wrapper function anymore (all it was doing was the light
   pre-processing on stim_df). it loads in the stimuli numpy array and
   stimulus description csv itself.

 - we only round the ferquency space distance if the stimuli are
   logpolar or pilot (not constant; since these weren't rounded during
   creation they'll line up exactly)

 - create_sf_maps_cpp (and the function that calls it) can now handle
   multiple stim_types.

 - variety of functions throughout stimuli.py have their calls to these
   functions changed to make sure they're working. for the most part,
   they can't handle constant stimuli and are only used for the logpolar
   ones.

 - mid_val now shows up in more functions, since we need to make sure we
   get the masking correct

 - instead of plotting the windowed views of the actual grating and the
   linear approximation side-by-side, we plot them in two separate
   figures (so they show up on top of each other in the notebook), since
   we want to be able to flip back and forth between them.

 - the subtracting of 1 from the between-approximation regions is now
   necessary for all gratings, for some reason

still to do:

 - finish testing

 - change the use of template paths?

 - add to Snakefile

terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws,1370ba4ef89edf1c57e5037126bc3a6d0613dec6,service/elbv2: Prevent panics with actions deleted outside Terraform,"

We will now always sort the API response by Action.Order for reading into the Terraform state. This could potentially cause a plan difference in configurations which list actions out of order so will need a note in the CHANGELOG, however this behavior seems more desirable than switching to schema.TypeSet and removing the ability to omit order from configurations.

update_router in json/network_client.py did not provide a way to update
the 'distributed' attribute of a router. Sending a rest call to a
system that does not support dvr (icehouse and older) or aa system with
dvr extension disabled will cause a failure, thus care must be taken to
only include the attribute in the rest call if it is explicitely
requested via the kwargs dict.

Tests Added:
-test_distributed_router_creation
-test_centralized_router_creation
-test_centralized_router_update_to_dvr

This is the more modern alternative to organize the application project
in ownCloud or Nextcloud, and leads to much cleaner directory
structure. When organizing the project files like this, the clouds
require also that the source files and folders follow the PSR-4 naming
conventions. That is, the directories matching the namespaces and files
matching the classes must now have name with identical capitalization
as compared to the namespace/class names. This is in contrast with the
previous practice of using all-lowercase file names.

Two classes were renamed during the process to follow the ""best
practices"":
APISerializer -> ApiSerializer
XMLResponse -> XmlResponse

chromium/chromium,c816f4a81e719fe89b2d4689ddc6f995bc125dc2,desks: Close context menu when activating desks.,"

This requires adding support to context menus to close without animation,
otherwise it will still be visible as the default close has a fade out
animation, and the screenshot will capture a near-opaque version of the
menu.

Accelerators by default will also close menus with fade out, so add the
desk activation acclerator to the exception list and let the desk
animation code handle the closing.

We've been documenting the value in bytes since its introduction
in commit b9a9b3a4 (v1.3), where it was actually reported in bytes.

Commit e4654d2 (v2.0) then removed things from block/qapi.c, in
preparation for a rewrite to a list of dirty sectors in the next
commit 21b5683 in block.c, but the new code mistakenly started
reporting in sectors.

libvirt/libvirt,3054dacf9a0289ce000153abd2c114fdc42eef21,networkUpdateState: Create virMacMap module more frequently,"

The virMacMap module is there for dumping [domain, <list of is
MACs>] pairs into a file so that libvirt_guest NSS module can use
it. Whenever a interface is allocated from network (e.g. on
domain<F2> startup or NIC hotplug), network is notified and so is
virMacMap module subsequently. The module update functions
networkMacMgrAdd() and networkMacMgrDel() gracefully handle the
case when there's no module. The problem is, the module is
created if and only if network is freshly started, or if the
daemon restarts and network previously had the module.

This is not very user friendly - if users want to use the NSS
module they need to destroy their network and bring it up again
(and subsequently all the domains using it).

One disadvantage of this approach implemented here is that one
may get just partial results: any already running network does
not record mac maps, thus only newly plugged domains will be
stored in the module. The network restart scenario is not touched
by this of course. But one can argue that older libvirts had
never recorded the mac maps anyway.

Additionally our test script had become fairly complicated and will
become even more complicated when testing of PIE buildmode is
introduced.

Windows).

tprrt/linux-stable,2f8da84def73e1dd89385146e1dbb2ae2c8e0a6a,phy: tegra: Fix regulator leak,"

Devices are created for each port of the XUSB pad controller. Each USB 2
and USB 3 port can potentially have an associated VBUS power supply that
needs to be removed when the device is removed.

Since port devices never bind to a driver, the driver core will not get
to perform the cleanup of device-managed resources that usually happens
on driver unbind.

Now, the driver core will also perform device-managed resource cleanup
for driver-less devices when they are released. However, when a device
link is created between the regulator and the port device, as part of
regulator_get(), the regulator takes a reference to the port device and
prevents it from being released unless regulator_put() is called, which
will never happen.

Avoid this by using the non-device-managed API and manually releasing
the regulator reference when the port is unregistered.

IsListType was causing ~100 allocations for a non list object. It is

Replace `%#v` with a typed error and create a cache of types that are
lists with a bounded size (probably not necessary, but safer).

Pass the range to be displayed to HarfBuzzShaper. The shaper calculates positions and advances of each glyph
regardless of the range, but only add glyphs which are in the range.

No new tests. platform/chromium-linux/fast/text/international/draw-complex-text-from-to.html should
work as expected once we move to use harfbuzz-ng on linux. Note that the current expectation will need to be rebaselined
because the old hb shaper (ComplexTextController) mishandles the range. |to| should be exclusive. I'll rebaseline

doing tasks for a frame.  Since a frame may run many tasks,
task completion messages are aggregated at two layers:
1. In the FrameScheduler, the task times are tallied until a
   threshold of 100ms is reached.
2. In the PageMetricsSender, sends are scheduled along with
   the PageLoadTiming data, which occurs at most once a second.

Currently, jobs that fail with ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED or
ERR_HOST_RESOLVER_QUEUE_TOO_LARGE are considered unfinished and not
recorded in histograms. I want to track these errors. In particular,
some error conditions can be recorded as either ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED or a
failure like ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED or ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED, and
these shouldn't disappear from all reporting when the error code
changes.

Also fix a bug where failure timing was accidentally recorded in
the success timing histograms.

Most LegacyUSBFactory usbdevice_init() methods realize with
qdev_init_nofail(), even though their caller usbdevice_create() can
handle failure.  Okay if it really can't fail (I didn't check), but
somewhat brittle.

usb_msd_init() and usb_bt_init() call qdev_init().  The latter
additionally reports an error when qdev_init() fails.

Realization failure produces multiple error reports: a specific one
from qdev_init(), and generic ones from usb_bt_init(),
usb_create_simple(), usbdevice_create() and usb_parse().

Remove realization from the usbdevice_init() methods.  Realize in
usbdevice_create(), and produce exactly one error message there.  You
still get another one from usb_parse().

imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage,3a8af223269ef046d0689068dead3d4f1ab1767e,Thread-parallel LLVM/JIT of shader groups.,"

We had a big single lock around all the LLVM compilation, so no two threads could JIT shaders at the same time (though of course, once compiled, threads may execute shaders simultaneously). I have done a refactor that gives each thread its own llvm::Context and various other structures that let threads independently compile separate shader groups in parallel.

The llvm_context, execution engine, module, and jit memory manager are no longer owned by the ShadingSystem. Instead, the context and jitmm are held by the PerThreadInfo, and the module and ee are ephemeral (created by one thread, destroyed as soon as the group is finished compiling).  The only thing held by the SS is a list of dangling jitmm pointers, since even after one thread terminates (and thus will no longer hold its private jitmm), that memory is still needed by the compiled x86 code, which may be executed by other threads that are still running! (Took me a full day to figure out that bug.) So instead those get ""owned"" by the SS, freed only at the very end.

The amount of locking goes down by quite a bit, though it's no silver bullet: if two threads both need the same not-yet-compiled shader group at the same time, one of them is going to wait while the other compiles, and that still happens quite often.

Fix exception containing stack trace

Right now the error message of `TransportException` can contain very long messages including stack traces of other exceptions. For example:

```

```

In my opinion the exception message should only contain messages of the other exceptions, not their stack traces. For example the exception message above would be reduced to this:

```
Failed to authenticate on SMTP server with username ""example@domain.tld"" using 1 possible authenticators. Authenticator LOGIN returned Expected response code 235 but got code ""535"", with message ""535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at

```

JetBrains/intellij-scala,8e2296d4f21009acb80b60533edfeedaeb25553a,Quick fix for ScalaLanguageLevel crashing with External build compiler,"

ScalaLanguageLevel.getLanguageLevel(element) would crash if
element.getContainingFile.getVirtualFile was null. This would pretty
much kill any Completion/Highlighting processes that touched it, as
in this bug report against Completion:

http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/SCL-5108

I think getVirtualFile() is supposed to return null iff the file
exists only in memory, however this was occurring for me with Scala
0.7.62/IU-123.94 on concrete *.scala source files.

I previously thought that this was occurring only when 'Use External
build' was enabled, but in fact the problem with getVirtualFile()
returning null seems independent of that.

A table with the metadata-keys as key could be easily accessed in the

daverigby/kv_engine,c399183b3bdee011681b6dcaba1f6b1f88968718,Refactor the RWLock to allow locking through a std::lock_guard,"

This patch alters the RWLock to refactor control of its reader
/ writer locking / unlocking through the use of `reader()` and
`writer()` member functions which return references to a
`ReaderLock` and `WriterLock` object respectively. These objects
both implement `BasicLockable` around their respective aspect
of the RWLock.

This allows the RWLock to be RAII managed by a std::lock_guard
instead of an application specific lock holder:

    RWLock rw;

    void my_func() {
        std::lock_guard<ReaderLock> rlh(rw.reader());
        // reader lock is held

        ...
    } // reader lock is released

This also moves exception based error control into the RWLock
class.

nwjs/chromium.src,2b62de0bf01e7c71c82719ec30e19a32ca251ad6,Fix deadlock issue in WebRtcMediaStreamTrackAdapterMap.,"

The fix is to reduce the scope of the |lock_| during track adapter
creation because Create[Local/Remote]TrackAdapter() may synchronize with
another thread that is busy waiting for the |lock_|. There is no reason
to hold the |lock_| while creating the adapter; we are ensured no other
adapters of the same kind (=local/remote) are created concurrently
because they may only be created on the appropriate thread (local =
main thread, remote = signaling thread) which is the thread currently
running the operation. In other words, at most 1
GetOrCreateLocalTrackAdapter() on the main thread and at most 1
GetOrCreateRemoteTrackAdapter() on the signaling thread can run at the
same time.

This is the equivalent of the WebRtcMediaStreamAdapterMap fix
(https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/868656/) but for the track
adapter map.

The deadlock is quite rare, but due to recent unrelated changes it has
become frequent enough that it is easily reproducible on some platforms
and applications, see bug.

The ClusterState class currently has a mutable volatile field ""status"" that is only used by the ClusterStateObserver to differentiate between a cluster state that is being applied or one that has already been applied. This commit removes the field from cluster state, making it a truly immutable class. This information is stored instead by ClusterService, which is the only place that should update this field (PublishClusterStateAction was also updating it, but that information was never used anywhere). A new class is introduced (ClusterServiceState) which emcompasses the current cluster state as well as the current status, which is only used by the ClusterStateObserver mechanism.",False,,,,,,,comsum_random_batch_12_july_2021,-1,False
dotnet/roslyn,b9ba3e9e4904794f0b51e2a6377ef70a31019184,TLDR: artifacts are going to move around in Binaries\Debug and the directory is going to get a lot bigger.,"

At a high level build projects can be classified into three categories based on how they write output:

- incorrect: a given output path is written to more than once with different contents
- less correct: a given output path is written to more than once but always with the same content
- correct: a given output path is written to exactly once

Today the roslyn build is decidedly “incorrect” as pretty much every file is written directly into Binaries\Debug. This means it ends up writing pretty much every Visual Studio SDK DLL twice: once for Dev14 and once for Dev15. For example at various points in the build Binaries\Debug\Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Data.dll may refer to Dev14 and at others it’s Dev15. If this seems like a scary proposition for a build that’s because it is indeed scary and it has real consequences. By now pretty much everyone on the team has hit the build race condition that is dragging down our PRs.

The general fix here is to move build outputs into separate directories. Instead of building to $(Configuration) projects now build into say $(Configuration)\Exes\$(MSBuildProjectFileName). This will have a substantial increase in the size of Binaries. We will be looking into ways to reduce that. In the short term though build stability far outweighs the size increase.

This change takes us most of the way to ""correct"". There are several places I had to compromise in order to get this initial change in:

- UnitTests still build to a common output folder (one for Dev14, another for Dev15). Pulling unit tests apart is going to take a bit of work.
- Every project has a <RoslynProjectType> entry. This will go away in the future for most projects. It's temporarily needed so I can fix roslyn-internal in parallel without taking down the build.
- VSL.Imports.targets is messy. Unavoidable for now due to the above. It will get cleaner as I iterate on this.

None of these are relevant to the underlying race condition. Hence it's okay to push them off.

chromium/chromium,4e89098c64d1b34fb72fdd6a20b24caefbdac0f8,Simplify when launcher suggestion chip results are created,"

Currently, the results shown in the suggestion chips are generated on
the previous launcher *close* ready for the next launcher open.
Speculatively, this is because the latency requirements for the chips
are tight, and generating app results may have been too slow in the
past.

However this out-of-step update is a source of bugs for non-app
results. All current providers of chip results appear to be more than
fast enough to produce results synchronously on launcher open. This CL
removes the on-close search, and adds an on-open search.

opendaylight/netvirt,61f953a58d181ec1afa1ac3205785443ad21e787,Prevent new code from using the DataBroker,"

This introduces a new Checkstyle check to fail the build if code
*calls* the newReadWriteTransaction or newWriteOnlyTransaction methods
in DataBroker. I haven’t found a nice way to make this check
conditional, so for now it’s added via a new parent module,
managed-tx-parent, which is used instead of binding-parent in all
modules which currently support it.

This patch is self-contained, but the plan is to move the Checkstyle
implementation to infrautils and the Checkstyle configuration to
Genius or MD-SAL, alongside ManagedNewTransactionRunner. Once all the
existing code has been converted to use only
ManagedNewTransactionRunner, we’ll be able to apply the configuration
to binding-parent and do away with managed-tx-parent.

Summary: `flow --version` was a bit of a hack. It should really be its own
command. As it's own command we can add options, like `--json`. And in the json
output we can put more useful information, like where the binary is actually
located and even the build id.

We need to leave `flow --version` in for legacy support for a little while, so
for now we can just mark it as deprecated.

mirroring, as mirroring can't fix certain cases where the anchor is
off-screen (e.g. in immersive mode, or when the browser window is
partially off-screen).

This makes the fix universal for almost all bubbles anchored to the
toolbar and location bar.

This is a cleanup CL and should not change behavior.

Before this CL, shared worker connection sequence consists of two pathes:

  1) SharedWorkerRepositoryClientImpl::conenct (in blink)
     - SharedWorkerRepository::createSharedWorkerConnector (in chromium)
       * sends a worker creation message to the browser
       * returns an instance of WebSharedWorkerProxy
  2) SharedWorkerRepositoryClientImpl::connect (in blink)
     - SharedWorkerConnector::connect (in blink)
       - WebSharedWorkerProxy::connect (in chromium)
         * sends a connection request to the browser

After this CL, they are merged into one path like this:

  1) SharedWorkerRepositoryClientImpl::connect (in blink)
     - SharedWorkerRepository::connect (in chromium)
       * creates an instance of WebSharedWorkerProxy
       - WebSharedWorkerProxy::connect (in chromium)
         * sends a worker creation message to the browser
         * sends a connection request to the browser

Some back-ends have the notion of tenancy on volumes
and set ownership in the driver.  The update of the DB
alone when doing volume transfers isn't enough, we need
to be able to propogate the update info all the way
down to the driver level.

This patch introduces the volume api/manger/rpc calls
and implements a stub in the base driver that can
be over-ridden for those that need to take some action.

tprrt/linux-stable,4ec6c0a2080bad4aafda0160f4d1ff984cebd452,drm/amd/display: Revalidate bandwidth before commiting DC updates,"

[Why]
Whenever we switch between tiled formats without also switching pixel
formats or doing anything else that recreates the DC plane state we
can run into underflow or hangs since we're not updating the
DML parameters before committing to the hardware.

[How]
If the update type is FULL then call validate_bandwidth again to update
the DML parmeters before committing the state.

This is basically just a workaround and protective measure against
update types being added DC where we could run into this issue in
the future.

We can only fully validate the state in advance before applying it to
the hardware if we recreate all the plane and stream states since
we can't modify what's currently in use.

The next step is to update DM to ensure that we're creating the plane
and stream states for whatever could potentially be a full update in
DC to pre-emptively recreate the state for DC global validation.

The workaround can stay until this has been fixed in DM.

Patch by Max Feil <mfeil@rim.com> on 2012-11-06
Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

Source/WebCore:

There is a requirement to have HTML5 video automatically enter
fullscreen when a video starts playing (PR131774). This change
implements this feature, with restrictions. The main restriction
is adherence to WebKit's philosophy of only entering fullscreen
due to a user gesture. This is important in order to avoid
pop-up advertisements and other unwanted fullscreen content.
One consequence of this is that video elements with the autoplay
attribute will not automatically enter fullscreen.

Other caveats:
- This feature applies only to ""small screen"" devices where
automatically going fullscreen makes more sense.
- Fullscreen will only be entered automatically when the
video is played from the beginning (current time is zero).
It is assumed that if the user is resuming play from a paused
state and is not in fullscreen mode, then they exited fullscreen
mode intentionally.

Stop using the deprecated base1/jquery.js file.  Our webpacks already
bundle jQuery, and most of our code is using that.

The global `jQuery` object is only necessary for various bootstrap and
flot extensions of jQuery. Replace the global `<script>` import with
expose-loader for the pages that use flot, and bootstrap-ui.

That now exposes only pure jQuery, while our previous base1/jquery.js
also had bootstrap bundled; so we now explicitly need to import
bootstrap on the pages that use it. This also makes these dependencies
more obvious and grep-able for porting to React.

A special case arises for tuned: Both that and shutdown.js use bootstrap
and require jQuery in the global namespace, but as tuned gets
dynamically embedded into the overview, expose-loader complains about
overriding the already existing jQuery symbol. This is ok, but create a
separate webpack rule for tuned to avoid doing this on other pages (and
in fact, let's port tuned to proper React ASAP).

Rooms are now deleted by using the standard ""destroy"" method of Backbone
models instead of calling the endpoint directly from the view. In a
similar way, the current user now removes herself from the room also by
destroying the model, but with a special URL. This will make possible to
listen to and handle the ""destroy"" event of the model from other places.

Leaving the current room when it is destroyed or removed was also moved
to the model; for consistency, the model now provides a method to join
the room too (which, in the end, will also synchronize the model).

* Observed frequent kube-scheduler and controller-manager
restarts with Calico as the CNI provider. Root cause was
unclear since control plane was functional and tests of

* Root cause: Calico sets up cali* and tunl* network interfaces
for containers on hosts. NetworkManager tries to manage these
interfaces. It periodically disconnected veth pairs. Logs did
not surface this issue since its not an error per-se, just Calico
and NetworkManager dueling for control. Kubernetes correctly
restarted pods failing health checks and ensured 2 replicas were
running so the control plane functioned mostly normally. Pod to
pod connecitivity was only affected occassionally. Pain to debug.
* Solution: Configure NetworkManager to ignore the Calico ifaces
per Calico's recommendation. Cloud-init writes files after
NetworkManager starts, so a restart is required on first boot. On
subsequent boots, the file is present so no restart is needed

luci/luci-go,9ae6a681e78e5ace008657e96d9e5c1d8cd1d08d,Differentiate between single- and multi- props.,"

Fixes #58.

Change PropertyMap to accept either a single Property or a
PropertySlice, the former being a single Property and the latter
being a multi-property regardless of content size.

This will likely break API compatibility for packages that directly use
PropertyMap, which shouldn't be too many. Updating is not difficult:

If you want to have a single property, you can assign directly instead
of wrapping in a []Property:

  PropertyMap{""Foo"": MkProperty(""Bar"")}

If you want to have a multi-valued Property, use a PropertySlice:

  PropertyMap{""Foo"": PropertySlice{ds.MkProperty(""Bar"")}}

Note that datastore now differentiates between single-valued Properties
and multi-valued Properties. When dealing with structs, luci/gae doesn't
really care when loading, but will export them as multi- if they are backed
by a slice.

This combine runs pretty late and causes us to introduce a shift after the op legalization phase has run. We need to be sure we create the shift with the proper type for the shift amount. If we don't do this, we will still re-legalize the operation properly, but we won't get a chance to fully optimize the truncate that gets inserted.

So this patch adds the necessary truncate when the shift is created. I've also narrowed the subtract that gets created to always be an i32 type. The truncate would have trigered SimplifyDemandedBits to optimize it anyway. But using a more appropriate VT here is free and saves an optimization step.

zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr,6de7a808af9d5ca7c6c47fba8fd68022c215fade,Bluetooth: Controller: ctrl pdu processing based on available CPU time,"

On CPUs like nRF51 which run at 16MHz, certain BLE control
procedure PDU processing take more CPU time than permitted
inside tIFS (150us). Current implementation of Data Length
Update procedure does not span over multiple connection
interval (unlike Encryption Setup, which is another control
procedure processing that would consume more CPU time)
hence taking more CPU time inside tIFS on nRF51.

During the radio ISR, the active clock and packet timer are
active and it is used to profile the CPU time taken which
is used to decide on whether there is sufficient time in
the current radio event to process the control packet.

This commit also fixes a potential bug that would cause
disconnection due to MIC failure on encrypted connections
that performed Data Length Update. Controller used to NACK
the request/response PDU if it was not in a state to resize
the receive buffers but did not reset the CCM counter. This
is now fixed by the change done to NACK control PDU based
on available CPU time in radio ISR.

the patch add the following logical changes:

* Removes the priv->logmsg variable, it was only used in one place anyway,
  also don't blindly get the counters when associating. Getting the
  counters then the user asks via WEXT for them is good enought.
* don't set wstats.discard.fragment with log.rxfrag, because the latter is
  a counter for successfully received packets, not for fragmented packets.

In the __diesel_schema_migrations tables, the run_on column was defined as:

  run_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT 'now'

While PostgreSQL worked fine, the old definition did now work in SQLite as
expected because it does not really store typed data in the columns
(everything is internally TEXT, the type being a hint on how to interpret it),
and it was actually storing the 'now' string value:

  % sqlite3 test.db
  sqlite> CREATE TABLE foo (v INTEGER, t TIMESTAMP DEFAULT 'now');
  sqlite> INSERT INTO foo (v) VALUES (42);
  sqlite> SELECT * FROM foo;
  42|'now'
  sqlite>

This patch makes the ""run_on"" column use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as the default
value, which works both for PostgreSQL and SQLite:

  sqlite> CREATE TABLE bar (v INTEGER, t TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
  sqlite> INSERT INTO bar (v) VALUES (10);
  sqlite> SELECT * FROM bar;

This reverts commit 386cb7cdeeef97e0bf082a8d6bbfc07a2ccce07b.

Taking the wake_worker() out of free_migration() will slow writeback
dramatically, and hence adaptability.

Say we have 10k blocks that need writing back, but are only able to
issue 5 concurrently due to the migration bandwidth: it's imperative
that we wake_worker() immediately after migration completion; waiting
for the next 1 second wake up (via do_waker) means it'll take a long
time to write that all back.

apache/mynewt-nimble,a493ab8a9d46cc54421755eb72324b7fdf093f3e,nimble/ll: Fix consecutive bits detection in AA,"

Initial value for number of consecutive bits should be 1, i.e. single
bit is ""1 consecutive bit"".

With this set to 0 we calculate number of consecutive bits 1 less than
we should and thus allow for 7 consecutive bits in AA which is invalid.

Also, in case 7 msb have the same value, we would detect this at the
last iteration of loop which means mask value is already set to final
value so invalid sequence won't be detected. To make this simple, let's
just set mask value to 0 in case consecutive bits violation is detected
so it is always properly detected as invalid sequence.

We unhash the dentry (in a subsequent patch) in ->d_revalidate() in order
to send mount requests to ->lookup().  But then we can not rely on
d_unhased() to give reliable results because it may be called at any time
by any code path.  The d_unhashed() function is used by __simple_empty()
in the path walking callbacks but autofs mount point dentrys should have
no directories at all so a list_empty() on d_subdirs should be (and is)
sufficient.

google/closure-compiler,adc0b3be92e9f8a1b510926feba6bb357c64deb2,BuildGlobalNamespace will not create duplicate Refs,"

Previously it was up to the caller of scanNewNodes() to avoid passing
BuildGlobalNamespace nodes that might already have references.
This has led to exceptions being thrown because multiple references
were created for the same Node.

This change makes BuildGlobalNamespace and the Name class it depends on smart
enough to avoid creation of additional Refs for the same Node even when
scanNewNodes() is passed AST nodes that already have Refs.

Effectively this means that code modifying the AST can safely pass any Nodes
they think may need reconsideration to the scanNewNodes() method and rely on
BuildGlobalNamespace to do the right thing.

On the other hand, I've added several checks to restrict changing a Ref's Node.

tprrt/linux-stable,e53f21c761d141bbcbce06e9ddab3b4e0a828f2c,clk: pistachio: Fix override of clk-pll settings from boot loader,"

PLL enable callbacks are overriding PLL mode (int/frac) and
Noise reduction (on/off) settings set by the boot loader which
results in the incorrect clock rate.

PLL mode and noise reduction are defined by the DSMPD and DACPD bits
of the PLL control register. PLL .enable() callbacks enable PLL
by deasserting all power-down bits of the PLL control register,
including DSMPD and DACPD bits, which is not necessary since
these bits don't actually enable/disable PLL.

This commit fixes the problem by removing DSMPD and DACPD bits
from the ""PLL enable"" mask.

following email and instructions sent out for use of new code:
I checked in all of the changes to the DB converter to support SQL Server conversions, as well as many fixes to the converter to support conversions of other databases.  

We now have 9+ databases available for converting and testing.  The mySQL dumps can be found at:
\\huxley\specify6\Specify5_Dbs_MySql

Of importance: RunMyContentsAtCommandLine.txt – 
Take the contents of this file, and run them at the commandline.  It references 2 script files “createSp5dbs.sql” and “createSp6dbs.sql” (make sure you are cd’d into this folder before running the commands).  This will get all of the necessary databases created, “attached” and permissioned on your MySQL server.  It will perform all of the necessary steps so that you can run “automatic” conversions (converter dialog will work at it did before with a picklist of available conversions for mysql - > mysql conversions).  There is also a text file that lists what Specify 5.X version the database is.

I’ve checked things in a little more prematurely than ideal, I didn’t want to hold up any longer, and the remaining fixes are fairly minor.  I can guarantee that the conversion works on kufish.  I’ve got to rerun the tests on the remaining dbs and make a couple tweaks. 

Don’t pull and expect to do a db conversion until you copy the new dumps and run the scripts.  I’ve change the code and removed all references to the old ones.

Anyone wanting to run a M$ server conversion will need to add the jtds jar to their build path.  Otherwise, it can be ignored.  Find it in the libs folder.

When one of these shared contexts is closed, GraphicsContext::close
deletes all GLObjects for that contextID, regardless of the fact that
they are shared.  This means that all of the other contexts sharing the

The attached tweak makes GraphicsContext::close a bit less brutal for
shared contexts.  I have also changed a misleading diagnostic message.

OISF/suricata,843d0b7a10bb45627f94764a6c5d468a24143345,stream: support RST getting lost/ignored,"

In case of a valid RST on a SYN, the state is switched to 'TCP_CLOSED'.
However, the target of the RST may not have received it, or may not
have accepted it. Also, the RST may have been injected, so the supposed
sender may not actually be aware of the RST that was sent in it's name.

In this case the previous behavior was to switch the state to CLOSED and
accept no further TCP updates or stream reassembly.

This patch changes this. It still switches the state to CLOSED, as this
is by far the most likely to be correct. However, it will reconsider
the state if the receiver continues to talk.

To do this on each state change the previous state will be recorded in
TcpSession::pstate. If a non-RST packet is received after a RST, this
TcpSession::pstate is used to try to continue the conversation.

If the (supposed) sender of the RST is also continueing the conversation
as normal, it's highly likely it didn't send the RST. In this case
a stream event is generated.

tprrt/linux-stable,5381837f125cc62ad703fbcdfcd7566fc81fd404,[SCSI] libsas: reuse the original port when hotplugging phys in wide ports,"

There's a hotplug problem in the way libsas allocates ports: it loops over the
available ports first trying to add to an existing for a wide port and
otherwise allocating the next free port.  This scheme only works if the port
array is packed from zero, which fails if a port gets hot unplugged and the
array becomes sparse.  In that case, a new port is formed even if there's a
wide port it should be part of.  Fix this by creating two loops over all the
ports:  the first to see if the phy should be part of a wide port and the
second to form a new port in an empty port slot.

Handle section alignment slightly better in coff, and comment where it
needs more work (on page-aligning virtual vs file addresses for DPAGED).
Use set_tdata everywhere that tdata is set, to avoid ""cast to the left
of assignment"" problems with some compilers.
Move bfd_alloc, bfd_zalloc, bfd_realloc, and bfd_release into libbfd.h
(from bfd.h) since they are internal routines.
Remove the redundant suffix ""_struct"" from struct tags.
Set symbol count early in file reading, before slurping in the syms,
for GDB's use.

habitat-sh/habitat,da730a62f3a258dc5983a6c6393295feae2f2a87,Streamline GatewayState struct,"

In preparation for some additional refactorings, this commit tightens
up the definition and role of the `GatewayState` struct. Now, it
consists solely of data that is ultimately served over the
Supervisor's HTTP gateway.

The gateway's optional authentication token is better understood as a
property of the gateway server itself. Thus, `GatewayAuthToken` is
moved into the `http_gateway` module (and renamed
`GatewayAuthenticationToken` to remove ambiguity). It is no longer
part of `GatewayState`, but is now part of the gateway's `AppState`
struct.

luci/luci-go,d65c2b2a5ebadb3ebfa0383630bbc1fa2b755a70,LogDog: Fix archival Get/Tail implementations.,"

The sparse index tail algorithm assumed that indexes always had an entry
for the last log in the index. This is not necessarily true for spare
indexes. Conseqently, archive Tail could return a non-tail entry in that
situation.

This also fixes the Get and Tail to be more robust against malformed index
and stream data files, to the point where it will happily operate
without an index if needed now.

However, this is actually a good idea, so update index generation to
always include a final entry to the index. Tail optimizes for this case.

This introduced yet another situation where the storage layer was
unmarshalling LogEntry protobufs, then passing the binary data up to the
higher level to unmarshal again! To prevent this from introducing
performance regressions, we now have the storage layer kick up a lazy
unmarshal-at-most-once struct instead of raw data. This will let higher
levels take advantage of storage layers that have to unmarshal
protobufs.

Finally, log archival fetching had no supporting unit tests. Write some,
with very high coverage.

When abusing the createVolume() method by passing numeric values
as UUIDs, the validation regex needs a string to process and
throws an exception when it isn't:

    m = UUID_REGEX.match(uuid)
TypeError: expected string or buffer

And on the client side, I get a less than useful error:

  File ""create_a_vm.py"", line 19, in vdsOK

We can test that the input is str or unicode before attempting to regex
if it's something else, raise an exception.

Now, I get:

Which explains to me my error quite well.

Also, the data length must be a multiple of block-size, so extend the

If a LogReaderService was already present when starting the logger
bundle, we were manually registering the KillbillLogWriter using a ServiceTracker,
but calling close on it right away. This was calling LogReaderServiceFactory#ungetService which
in turn was calling LogReaderServiceImpl#removeAllLogListeners (i.e.
removing the Kill Bill log listener).

Revisit that scenario by simply manually constructing a REGISTERED
ServiceEvent and letting our ServiceListener take care of the
registration.

This fixes #100.

Historic versions leveraged a format of ""server_$UUID"" to name of the VPN server certificate for X509 verification.  This seems very impersonal.  The new code pulls the existing hostname of the machines and appends the 16 character UUID.  The new format is $hostname_$UUID.

Example:
A machine named ""Martian"" with a UUID of 1234567890123456 would change from server_1234567890123456 to Martian_1234567890123456",False,,,,,,,comsum_random_batch_12_july_2021,-1,False

facebook/buck,6586f3c231b11dc3f4ef0f849b4e81a2fbefafcd,Allow disabling of implicit native rules,"

Summary: Allow a parser to disable accessing native rules implicitly in build files. If configured, this forces users to explicitly import rules to use, and only allows native rules inside of extension files via native.XXX. This also fixes a bug where the skylark parser was exporting native rules into the global namespace in extension files.

Test Plan: Added unit tests, integration tests, and manually created a repo and tried with all of the permutations in the tests.

wolenetz@ asked on https://codereview.chromium.org/251893002/ why
we allow set_duration() to be called.  It used to be required since
AudioBuffers had no concept of sample rate.  However, we now attach
a sample rate to every AudioBuffer which allows us to enforce a
valid duration for every buffer.

This CL also aligns MakeAudioBuffer() to do the same thing with
planar and interleaved data for the sake of easier testing.

## What does this PR do ?

Adds a method to refresh an internal collection.  
Before Kuzzle v2, we had this method to refresh the internal index.

It is useful if you want to create a large number of internal documents (eg: users) and you want to refresh the internal users collection only at the end.

### Other changes

  - Modify the SinceBadge of the rate limit system to `2.1.0` since it will be the next version number

couchbase/ns_server,55afad2249139ddd5426bd790cb2fa1f43a3ff4e,set default bucket name with respect to permissions,"

- this change is intended to replace setDefaultBucketName implementation.
  I suggest use uiState instead of redirectTo. We can read the bucket
  names right from $scope since we always have relevant buckets
  distributed on the scope. uiState is a directive that very similar to
  uiSref, but it $observes and $watches/evaluates all its inputs, so the
  href of the links will always have right bucket parameter value.

Also

 - correctly cache getBucketsByType method
 - do not reloadPermissions when buckets.uri has been changed. The
   behaviour was fixed on the server.

any effect on what a page actually executes. Currently, however, setting
a 'script-src' directive that doesn't whitelist 'unsafe-eval' actually
blocks 'eval()' on the page. This patch fixes that by checking whether
we're in report-only mode before turning 'eval()' off inside the script
engine.

This leaves us in a weird state, however. We don't currently have any
mechanism of explaining to the VM that we just want to be notified of
'eval()' usage. I've filed http://wkbug.com/111869 to cover this
aspect.

Test: http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/eval-allowed-in-report-only-mode.html

* page/ContentSecurityPolicy.cpp:
(WebCore::ContentSecurityPolicy::didReceiveHeader):
    For each policy we parse, check that we're only turning off eval in
    the VM when we're in enforce mode. If we're in report-only mode,
    skip it.

LayoutTests:

* http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/eval-allowed-in-report-only-mode-expected.txt: Added.
* http/tests/security/contentSecurityPolicy/eval-allowed-in-report-only-mode.html: Added.

There was previously no way to detect a type that is nominally
Optional at runtime. The standard library, namely OutputStream, needs
to handle Optionals specially in order to cirumvent conversion to the

facebookexperimental/eden,90cfd27c372415a55566660024fb0fc4e3168fd9,add configPath_ field to EdenServer,"

Summary:
Include a configPath_ field for EdenServer that holds the path of the user ~/.edenrc config file. The server needs the data from this user config file in order to perform mounts and currently, the path to the home directory is passed via the CLI to the mount command as a field inside the MountInfo struct in order to get the file. As per discussion in D3498567, including the home directory inside the MountInfo struct is logically a bit disjointed, and this change would no longer require the home directory to be passed to the server via MountInfo.

This restructuring also sets up eden for a future change - having the server remount existing mount points on start-up is now possible from the inside. Before this change, mounting anything had to be done via the CLI since the home directory had to be passed in from the outside. This meant that remounting the existing mount points on start up could only be done if Eden was run in the background - running in the foreground would require manual remounting of all existing mount points. Now that the server has access to the config file's path, remounting can be done without any prompting from the CLI in both cases.

docs(*): add @public tag to public modules

The template was referencing an invalid property
chore(doc-gen): use `@exportedAs` and `@public` rather than `@publicModule`

This commit refactors how we describe components that are re-exported in another
module. For example the ""public"" modules like `angular/angular` and `angular/annotations`
are public but they only re-export components from ""private"" modules.

Previously, you must apply the `@publicModule` tag to a component that was to be
re-exported. Applying this tag caused the destination module to become public.

Now, you specify that a module is public by applying the `@public` tag and then
you can ""re-export"" components to other modules by applying the `@exportedAs`
giving the name of the module from which the component will be re-exported.
tag. This tag can be used multiple times on a single component, allowing the
component to be exported on multiple modules.

docs(*): rename `@publicModule` to `@exportedAs`

The `@publicModule` dgeni tag has been replaced by the `@exportedAs`
dgeni tag on components that are to be re-exported on another module.

Currently we are sharing the total flusher batch limit across all
shards. This is problematic for our default configuration though which
has 1 shard per core and 4 writer threads as it over-limits the amount
that a single thread can flush when we have more than 4 cores. It also
makes the flusher_total_batch_limit configuration parameter difficult
to use as it requires knowledge of both shards and writers to calcualte.

Split the flusher_total_batch_limit by writers instead of shards so that
we don't negatively affect the default configuration and make
calculating the per flush limit and max concurrent limit easier.

an 'unhandled fault' is causes when a gadget driver calls
usb_gadget_connect() while the USB cable isn't plugged into
the OTG port.

the fault is caused by an access to MUSB's memory space
while its clock is turned off due to pm_runtime kicking
in.

in order to fix the fault, we enclose musb_gadget_pullup()
with pm_runtime_get_sync() ... pm_runtime_put() calls to
be sure we will always reach that path with clock turned on.

tprrt/linux-stable,035534ed3377d9def2c17717899fd64a111a785b,canfd: remove redundant CAN FD flag,"

The first idea of the CAN FD implementation started with a new struct
canfd_frame to be used for both CAN FD frames and legacy CAN frames.
The now mainlined implementation supports both CAN frame types simultaneously
and distinguishes them only by their required sizes: CAN_MTU and CANFD_MTU.

Only the struct canfd_frame contains a flags element which is needed for the
additional CAN FD information. As CAN FD implicitly means that the 'Extened
Data Length' mode is enabled the formerly defined CANFD_EDL bit became
redundant and also confusing as an unset bit would be an error and would
always need to be tested.

This patch removes the obsolete CANFD_EDL bit and clarifies the documentation
for the use of struct canfd_frame and the CAN FD relevant flags.

being enough room for the move range line in the code cell.

The CSS has been fixed to address all this. We still show a 4px move
range line, but now it's spread across the line number header and code
cell, 3px in the header and 1px in the cell. This takes advantage of the
spacing we already have available in both cells without worrying about
bumping right up against any text, or having to increase the default
padding in either cell.

Testing Done:
Tested in Chrome and Firefox. Checked for perfect pixel alignment in the
cells.

nwjs/chromium.src,ceba6362e17571ac33de89ce7aa42948f3968c2e,Migrate MessageLoop::current() to MessageLoopCurrent in /device,"

These changes were scripted as part of the effort to restrict exposure of the
raw MessageLoop*.

Note that many static methods exposed on MessageLoopCurrent are also deprecated
so it is very well possible that this is migrating to an already deprecated
method.

The goal of this pass is to reduce usage of MessageLoop::current() (and
ultimately make it impossible to obtain the MessageLoop* statically).

As such I will not edit this CL unless the script did something logically wrong.
I defer to owners to fix highlighted usage of already deprecated APIs.

Possible script screw ups / things to look out for in this review:
 - Storing MessageLoopCurrent in a MessageLoop* variable or comparing it against
   one (I will go over that in a separate pass).

Includes should have been stripped if that was the last usage of message_loop.h
in that file.

Please CQ if LGTY

This begins the process of extracting RWH and RVH interfaces and
leaving RenderWidgetHostImpl and RenderViewImpl classes in content.
There will be parallel inheritance hierarchies, i.e. RWHImpl inherits
from RWH, RVH inherits from RWH, RVHImpl inherits from RVH and
RWHImpl.  Thus, chrome will only see the interfaces.

I fully expect that some of the things chrome needs from the RVH
interface, once I introduce that, will more properly belong on the RWH
interface, in which case I expect to move them there.  But first to
define the base interfaces.

flaky because they take too long.

This CL re-enables the disabled tests on Windows but they should now
take 10% of the time they used to. Tested locally on Linux, the disabled
tests that each took ~20s to finish now take under 2.

The total running time of the entire suite locally was reduced from
390s to 49s.

Since we are doing a assert call checking a url without no page.waitForSelector
or similar calls, we add this to avoid flakes where the assert is called
when we are in process of navigation to the page. Also, we use Promise.all
here, and call page.waitForNavigation first, to avoid race conditions where
form is submitted quickly and navigation occurs and then we are stuck waiting
for a navigation. There were no flakes in the CI related to this issue, but

Explanation: the 'repositor - revert' (rrv) command is modeled on the
Subversion 'revert' command. The purpose of the command is to get rid of any
changes in the local directory (and in its subdirectories). The best way to do
this in Git is with 'git checkout'.

This commit changes the Git implementation of (rrv) to use 'git checkout'
instead of 'git reset'.

Note that 'git reset' is preserved in the IDE. The IDE uses 'git reset' to
clean up after adding test artifacts to the repository.

Acquiring the Clutter lock to mark critical sections is not portable,
and not recommended to implement threaded applications with Clutter.

The recommended pattern is to use worker threads, and schedule UI
updates inside idle or timeout handlers within the main loop. We should
enforce this pattern by deprecating the threads_enter()/leave()
functions. For compatibility concerns, we need internal API to acquire
the main lock during frame processing dispatch.

lxc/lxd,dc9bca756dce896230e5596557f9c32e1543f6f7,Initial work on a LXC to LXD script,"

This new script supports migrating most privileged containers to LXD
containers. It supports all the networking and bind-mount options that
LXD itself does, it also properly sets the nesting mode, boot options
and environment variables.

Various options are available to migrate all or just some specific
containers, specify custom lxcpath and lxdpath, make a copy of the
container or move the data and delete the source, ...

Security knobs which LXD doesn't provide cause an error so containers do
not accidently get migrated to a configuration which is less secure.

Unprivileged containers will require some extra work to unmap and remap
them to the LXD range.

tprrt/linux-stable,e39435ce68bb4685288f78b1a7e24311f7ef939f,lib/percpu_counter.c: fix bad percpu counter state during suspend,"

I got a bug report yesterday from Laszlo Ersek in which he states that
his kvm instance fails to suspend.  Laszlo bisected it down to this
commit 1cf7e9c68fe8 (""virtio_blk: blk-mq support"") where virtio-blk is
converted to use the blk-mq infrastructure.

After digging a bit, it became clear that the issue was with the queue
drain.  blk-mq tracks queue usage in a percpu counter, which is
incremented on request alloc and decremented when the request is freed.
The initial hunt was for an inconsistency in blk-mq, but everything
seemed fine.  In fact, the counter only returned crazy values when
suspend was in progress.

When a CPU is unplugged, the percpu counters merges that CPU state with
the general state.  blk-mq takes care to register a hotcpu notifier with
the appropriate priority, so we know it runs after the percpu counter
notifier.  However, the percpu counter notifier only merges the state
when the CPU is fully gone.  This leaves a state transition where the
CPU going away is no longer in the online mask, yet it still holds
private values.  This means that in this state, percpu_counter_sum()
returns invalid results, and the suspend then hangs waiting for
abs(dead-cpu-value) requests to complete which of course will never
happen.

Fix this by clearing the state earlier, so we never have a case where
the CPU isn't in online mask but still holds private state.  This bug
has been there since forever, I guess we don't have a lot of users where
percpu counters needs to be reliable during the suspend cycle.

AsynkronIT/protoactor-go,310f589bc4d96322ec8308c3694e8dad3ef6604a,constant sleep time for router actor  (#76),"

* ConsistentHashRouter: race condition

The consistent hash router suffered from concurrent map read and
write problem. Moreover, since hash ring and hashmap are being
updated separately, there is a race condition where node is selected
from the old hashring but passed to the new hashmap. When a node is
removed, this can cause messages to be routed to a nonexistent node.

A container is introduced to wrap these variables. Updating it only
happens after the new structures are created and the pointer is
updated at once. Also, a local copy of the pointer is made upon
reading from the container to avoid the second problem.

* ConsistentHashRouter: test concurrency

This test adds and removes multiple nodes, and route messages all
at the same time to test how well the system behave under concurrent
accesses.

* routeractor: Removed node needs to be stopped
When a node is removed from the routees list, it should be stopped,
otherwise it will remain in the system without having any messages
to process.

However, the stop messages should be sent with a delay to give the
removed node to be able to process the messages in its mailbox
(similar to how AKKA does it). Currently, a goroutine is spawned to
stop the actor after a timeout, but this needs to be fixed when
alternative ways are available.

* routeractor: replaced Stop with sending a poison pill

* routeractor: Sleep instead of creating a goroutine + timer

tprrt/linux-stable,b5a10c5f7532b7473776da87e67f8301bbc32693,nvme: apply DELAY_BEFORE_CHK_RDY quirk at probe time too,"

Commit 54adc01055b7 (""nvme/quirk: Add a delay before checking for adapter
readiness"") introduced a quirk to adapters that cannot read the bit
NVME_CSTS_RDY right after register NVME_REG_CC is set; these adapters
need a delay or else the action of reading the bit NVME_CSTS_RDY could
somehow corrupt adapter's registers state and it never recovers.

When this quirk was added, we checked ctrl->tagset in order to avoid
quirking in probe time, supposing we would never require such delay
during probe. Well, it was too optimistic; we in fact need this quirk
at probe time in some cases, like after a kexec.

In some experiments, after abnormal shutdown of machine (aka power cord
unplug), we booted into our bootloader in Power, which is a Linux kernel,
and kexec'ed into another distro. If this kexec is too quick, we end up
reaching the probe of NVMe adapter in that distro when adapter is in
bad state (not fully initialized on our bootloader). What happens next
is that nvme_wait_ready() is unable to complete, except if the quirk is
enabled.

So, this patch removes the original ctrl->tagset verification in order
to enable the quirk even on probe time.

Technically, this can change behavior as we no longer require the
existence of the ProfileSummaryInfo analysis to use local profile
information via BFI. We didn't actually require the PSI to have an
interesting profile though, so this only really impacts the behavior in
non-default pass pipelines.

IMO, this makes it substantially less surprising how everything works --
before an analysis that wasn't actually used had to exist to trigger
*any* profile aware inlining. I think the new organization makes it more
obvious where various checks for profile signals happen.

There are extensions to 386 psABI:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ia32-abi/awsRSvJOJfs

to call tls_get_addr via GOT:

call *___tls_get_addr@GOT(%reg)

where EBX register isn't required as GOT base.

Since direct call is 4-byte long and indirect call, is 5-byte long, the
extra one byte must be handled properly.

For general dynamic model, 7-byte lea instruction before call
instruction is replaced by 6-byte one to make room for indirect call.
For local dynamic model, we simply use 5-byte indirect call.

TLS linker optimization is updated to recognize new instruction
patterns.  For local dynamic model to local exec model transition,
we generate a 6-byte lea instruction as nop, instead of a 1-byte nop
plus a 4-byte lea instruction.

Calling XML validation results in hitting the Apple web servers
to load a DTD for plists http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd
to correctly validate the XML file.

Given that this test is not about whether it is possible to read
or write property lists, but they're just being used to validate
that they can read and write arrays from them, remove this part
of the test. The property list gets parsed from the subsequent
PropertyListSerialization call anyway, which will do the same error
checking as if the document is valid (but probably with a hard-coded
DTD instead of a network accessible one)

tprrt/linux-stable,c15227de132f1295f3db6b7df9079956b1020fd8,block: use normal I/O path for discard requests,"

prepare_discard_fn() was being called in a place where memory allocation
was effectively impossible.  This makes it inappropriate for all but
the most trivial translations of Linux's DISCARD operation to the block
command set.  Additionally adding a payload there makes the ownership
of the bio backing unclear as it's now allocated by the device driver
and not the submitter as usual.

It is replaced with QUEUE_FLAG_DISCARD which is used to indicate whether
the queue supports discard operations or not.  blkdev_issue_discard now
allocates a one-page, sector-length payload which is the right thing
for the common ATA and SCSI implementations.

The mtd implementation of prepare_discard_fn() is replaced with simply
checking for the request being a discard.

Largely based on a previous patch from Matthew Wilcox <matthew@wil.cx>
which did the prepare_discard_fn but not the different payload allocation
yet.

The task->il_next variable stores the next allocation node id for task's
MPOL_INTERLEAVE policy.  mpol_rebind_nodemask() updates interleave and
bind mempolicies due to changing cpuset mems.  Currently it also tries
to make sure that current->il_next is valid within the updated nodemask.
This is bogus, because 1) we are updating potentially any task's
mempolicy, not just current, and 2) we might be updating a per-vma
mempolicy, not task one.

The interleave_nodes() function that uses il_next can cope fine with the
value not being within the currently allowed nodes, so this hasn't
manifested as an actual issue.

We can remove the need for updating il_next completely by changing it to
il_prev and store the node id of the previous interleave allocation
instead of the next id.  Then interleave_nodes() can calculate the next
id using the current nodemask and also store it as il_prev, except when
querying the next node via do_get_mempolicy().

hashicorp/terraform,0b1dbf31a37f2d68000e5f652fbaa5b58626a2a1,core: close provider/provisioner connections,"

Currently Terraform is leaking goroutines and with that memory. I know
strictly speaking this maybe isn’t a real concern for Terraform as it’s
mostly used as a short running command line executable.

But there are a few of us out there that are using Terraform in some
long running processes and then this starts to become a problem.

Next to that it’s of course good programming practise to clean up
resources when they're not needed anymore. So even for the standard
command line use case, this seems an improvement in resource management.

Personally I see no downsides as the primary connection to the plugin
is kept alive (the plugin is not killed) and only unused connections
that will never be used again are closed to free up any related
goroutines and memory.

Removes redundant instructions from the platform-specific plages and the main ""get the code"" page on the sites page. The platform pages should have only non-redundant platform-specific information.

When I did this the Linux page was basically empty with a link the the prerequistes page, so I consolidated these two pages, leaving a placeholder in the old prerequisites page for now to avoid breaking links.

There was a lot of out-of-date information removed.

The frontend keeps an in-memory cache of these translations should the Config Service be unavailable at any point in the future, so that translations can still be served.

gjasny/v4l-utils,3719cef229379f1f2cb2fe61f2359bdac6cff6b0,libdvbv5: reimplement the logic that gets a full section,"

The logic that gets a full section is broken: it expects to
receive the sections in order, and not to receive the same
section segment twice.

Reimplement it.

As a side effect, it no longer needs to wait for a section
repeat, with speeds up the code.

On my tests with an ATSC signal, before this patch, scanning
to a single frequency was spending 1.850 secs. After the
patch, dvbv5-scan is now spending 1.432 secs.

That means a 418 ms save per frequency.

This fixes two bugs with the free space cache checker.  First is we apparently
always use root->sectorsize for our unit in the kernel so we have to do that in
progs otherwise bitmaps turn out to not look right if we have leafsize !=
sectorsize.  The second is a small issue if we had skinny metadata extents set,
we wouldn't advance last properly because we unconditionally use key.offset
instead of root->leafsize.  Thanks,

Remove scripts and templates which dealt with Pacemaker and its
resource restarts before we moved to containerized deployments. These
should all now be unused.

Many environments had this mapping:

    OS::TripleO::Tasks::ControllerPreConfig: OS::Heat::None
    OS::TripleO::Tasks::ControllerPostConfig: OS::Heat::None
    OS::TripleO::Tasks::ControllerPostPuppetRestart: ../../extraconfig/tasks/post_puppet_pacemaker_restart.yaml

The ControllerPostPuppetRestart is only ever referenced from
ControllerPostConfig, so if ControllerPostConfig is OS::Heat::None, it
doesn't matter what ControllerPostPuppetRestart is mapped to.

case to ensure that the behavior is correct.

Due to our previous temporary fix, we set |scrolling_touch_action_| to

we do:
PS#1: remove the set |scrolling_touch_action_| to Auto at GSB, and
the test will crash.
PS#2: Keep 1, add a line in CrossProcessFrameConnector::BubbleScrollEvent
which sets the |scrolling_touch_action_| to Auto. The test will pass.
PS#3: Keep the temporary fix which sets |scrolling_touch_action_| to
Auto at GSB.

rspec/rspec-support,6c3300a7cf24d952c3b456b078d3982da7db962c,Include delegators in inspection output,"

In current spec output, it’s not immediately obvious when an object
under test is actually wrapped in a delegator of some sort, which can
lead to some tricky-to-track-down failures on equality checks for two
seemingly-identical objects.

The fix proposed here is to toss objects into a special wrapper when we
prepare them for inspection. This wrapper recursively modifies the
object’s inspection string with delegator class information, which
should make it much more apparent when the object under test is wrapped
by a delegator of some sort.

This isn't a great idea for security reasons, but is how Samba3 behaves,
and allows kerberos to function more often in some environments.  It is
only available for CIFS session setups, due to the ordering of the

Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
Post-install message from i18n:

HEADS UP! i18n 1.1 changed fallbacks to exclude default locale.
But that may break your application.

If you are upgrading your Rails application from an older version of Rails:

Please check your Rails app for 'config.i18n.fallbacks = true'.
If you're using I18n (>= 1.1.0) and Rails (< 5.2.2), this should be
'config.i18n.fallbacks = [I18n.default_locale]'.
If not, fallbacks will be broken in your app by I18n 1.1.x.

If you are starting a NEW Rails application, you can ignore this notice.

tprrt/linux-stable,5ade2c2f5813733f23bbb2f21e8ba5c3f8474a2b,drm/i915: wait for IPS_ENABLE when enabling IPS,"

At the end of haswell_crtc_enable we have an intel_wait_for_vblank
with a big comment, and the message suggests it's a workaround for
something we don't really understand. So I removed that wait and
started getting HW state readout error messages saying that the IPS
state is not what we expected.

I investigated and concluded that after you write IPS_ENABLE to
IPS_CTL, the bit will only actually become 1 on the next vblank. So
add code to wait for the IPS_ENABLE bit. We don't really need this
wait right now due to the wait I already mentioned, but at least this
one has a reason to be there, while the other one is just to
workaround some problem: we may remove it in the future.

The wait also acts as a POSTING_READ which we missed.

The driver was requesting for a writethrough mapping. But with those
flags we will end up with an SAO mapping because we now have memory
conherence always enabled. ie, the existing mapping will end up with a
WIMG value 0b1110 which is Strong Access Order.

Update this to use cache inhibitted guarded mapping.

tox 1.6 was released, which means that we can now take advantage of the
feature we added to it - which is using setup.py develop to install the
code into the virtualenv. The logic was taken from run_tests.sh - so the
performance issues around using tox vs. using install_venv should now be
gone.

tprrt/linux-stable,630994b3c798dec3de1fb1d5a3dd9201267036f6,KVM: x86: add module parameter to disable periodic kvmclock sync,"

The periodic kvmclock sync can be an undesired source of latencies.

When running cyclictest on a guest, a latency spike is visible.
With kvmclock periodic sync disabled, the spike is gone.

Guests should use ntp which means the propagations of ntp corrections
from the host clock are unnecessary.

v2:
-> Make parameter read-only (Radim)
-> Return early on kvmclock_sync_fn (Andrew)

facebook/buck,8ce226cd2da6ac107d7db9535d6db4a1ac16211a,BuildCommand: the default result is an error,"

Summary:
The current logic and implementation may result that in SimpleConsole (with `-c ui.superconsole=DISABLED`) a failure may be reported as a success first and then as a true failure. This can happen because `BuildCommand`:
1. assumes SUCCESS as an initial status
2. doesn't handle all exceptions
3. issues a build finished `event` in the finally block `params.getBuckEventBus().post(BuildEvent.finished(started, exitCode));`

This change ensures that for `buck build` success will be reported only if it was a real success

adjacent, bash considers them a single word: (... lirc :: X).

In _stbt_get_prev, ""lirc::<TAB>"" matched ""::"" (in $p) against the glob
pattern ""[=:]*"", so lirc remote names were suggested correctly;
but after you typed a letter (""lirc::x<TAB>"") the ""::"" goes in $pp

Add AppArmor feature gate

Add option to disable AppArmor via a feature gate. This PR treats AppArmor as Beta, and thus depends on https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/31471 (I will remove `do-not-merge` once that merges).

Note that disabling AppArmor means that pods with AppArmor annotations will be rejected in validation. It does not mean that the components act as though AppArmor was never implemented. This is by design, because we want to make it difficult to accidentally run a Pod with an AppArmor annotation without AppArmor protection.

`now dev` integration tests have been failing as of recently with failures to require Runtime builders from the builder cache. Upon investigation, it turns out that the `builders.tar.gz` file was not being completely extracted since the integration tests complete quickly and then kill the Now CLI process, which has not yet completed the extraction.

Fix is to ensure the tarball extraction promise is fully resolved before cleanly shutting down.

The setup.py had incorrect version from Falcon. The module
was updated in authors test environment but the Dockerfile
installed still 1.4.1 because the Dockerfile run the setup
[docker] target. This means that the v0.10.0 Docker image
was still released with Falcon 1.4.1.

The change of new Falcon version is taken into use in the
coming v0.11.0 Docker image.

containerd/containerd,a5d246404cd9748271f704770107d65701029f23,Reconnect to shim event stream after containerd restart,"

There are three aspects which need to be covered:

 - the runtime needs to restart its event pump when it reconnects (in
   loadContainer).
 - on the server side shim needs to monitor the stream context so it knows when
   the connection goes away.
 - if the shim's stream.Send() fails (because the stream died between taking
   the event off the channel and calling stream.Send()) then to avoid losing
   that event the shim should remember it and send it out first on the next
   stream.

The shim's event production machinery only handles producing a single event
stream, so add an interlock to ensure there is only one reader of the
`s.events` channel at a time. Subsequent attempts to use Events will block
until the existing owner is done.

Fixes #921.

nwjs/chromium.src,e7b75b84514adffc3f0a494e82c7de22708b0ec6,Move DidScroll callback to be based on element ids,"

This patch makes WebLayerScrollClient take an ElementId
parameter. Using this change, the cc::Layer->ScrollableArea
callback (DidScroll) has been moved to ScrollingCoordinator so
cc::Layer can be independent of the ScrollableArea lifetime.

apple/swift,48fe3e1c9bbc710f4890be4b53f2830fafaebc8e,SILGen: Fix static computed properties in protocol extensions,"

We need to keep the AST formal type of the base around when building up
lvalues.

When the getter or setter involves an accessor call, we would use the
lowered type of the self argument to form the call. However, it might be
at the wrong level of abstraction, causing a @thin -vs- @thick metatype
mismatch. Using the formal type instead allows SILGenApply logic to emit
a thin to thick metatype conversion if necessary.

Fixes <rdar://problem/21358641>.

It used to be that multiple calls to delete textures from the impl thread
would cause problems, so we (1) always deleted everything when deleting
anything and (2) didn't allow multiple delete calls without being acknowledged
by the main thread.

This isn't the case anymore, but one of the calls to delete all contents
textures in the single thread proxy at shut-down wasn't updated. As a result,
these textures would still exist when the prioritized resource manager was
destroyed, triggering an assert.

This assert started appearing when we started keeping some contents textures
of backgrounded tabs around (breaking assumption 1 from above).

Change ThreadedTest to defer Composite calls while the LTH is nonvisible.
This matches the behavior of the ui::Compositor. Without this change, evicted
resources are cleaned up immediately and the new test doesn't trigger the
assert.

tprrt/linux-stable,8531e283bee66050734fb0e89d53e85fd5ce24a4,PCI: Recognize Thunderbolt devices,"

Detect on probe whether a PCI device is part of a Thunderbolt controller.
Intel uses a Vendor-Specific Extended Capability (VSEC) with ID 0x1234
on such devices.  Detect presence of this VSEC and cache it in a newly
added is_thunderbolt bit in struct pci_dev.

Also, add a helper to check whether a given PCI device is situated on a
Thunderbolt daisy chain (i.e., below a PCI device with is_thunderbolt
set).

The necessity arises from the following:

* If an external Thunderbolt GPU is connected to a dual GPU laptop,
  that GPU is currently registered with vga_switcheroo even though it
  can neither drive the laptop's panel nor be powered off by the
  platform.  To vga_switcheroo it will appear as if two discrete
  GPUs are present.  As a result, when the external GPU is runtime
  suspended, vga_switcheroo will cut power to the internal discrete GPU
  which may not be runtime suspended at all at this moment.  The
  solution is to not register external GPUs with vga_switcheroo, which
  necessitates a way to recognize if they're on a Thunderbolt daisy
  chain.

* Dual GPU MacBook Pros introduced 2011+ can no longer switch external
  DisplayPort ports between GPUs.  (They're no longer just used for DP
  but have become combined DP/Thunderbolt ports.)  The driver to switch
  the ports, drivers/platform/x86/apple-gmux.c, needs to detect presence
  of a Thunderbolt controller and, if found, keep external ports
  permanently switched to the discrete GPU.

v2: Make kerneldoc for pci_is_thunderbolt_attached() more precise,
    drop portion of commit message pertaining to separate series.

nwjs/chromium.src,8ffd816e4ec7c97037295c595345c8d785ed5aa1,Show video layer in fullscreen for WebRTC,"

This change reverts some of the changes we did for fullscreen video on android.
For fullscreen video, we hide the video layer and only show the media controls.
However, in WebRTC case, the video frame, instead of a texture, contains all the pixel data.
And the video frame is painted directly onto the layer without the help of a surface texture/surface view.
As a result, we shouldn't hide the fullscreen video layer if the video is WebRTC.

Test: Since this just reverts the logic for certain fullscreen video on android, no test is added as desktop fullscreen video tests should cover the case.

coreboot/coreboot,dd6c4ec1ed64f3d9803cca6eb53fa5049cacdd09,libpayload: Remove unnecessary keyboard mode setting code,"

keyboard_init attempts to read the existing mode register, set the
'XLATE' bit, and write it back. The implementation is buggy because the
keyboard may be active at the time we read the mode, and we can
misinterpret scancode data as the reply to our command. It leads to
problems where the KB gets disabled in firmware.

In fact, setting the 'XLATE' bit is completely unnecessary, even if we
desire QEMU keyboard support. We already set this bit when we initialize
the keyboard in pc_keyboard_init. Basically, this code does nothing
(or worse), so just remove it.

The OSSEC-related config tests have been weak, mostly checking the
contents of files on disk rather than validating functionality.

Updated the config test logic to check for the ""postfix"" service state
explicitly, and made its state conditional based on YAML testinfra vars.
Same as the Ansible tasks, the config tests treat ""enabled"" and ""state""
attributes of the service identically.

Also updated the networking config tests on the Monitor Server. Moved
the port 25 check (SMTP) to the Postfix testinfra file. We weren't checking
for authd NOT running before, now we are. (The authd service should
run only briefly, until OSSEC clients are registered, then stop.)

domain. This patch adds such separate driver for a group of such clocks,
which can be instantiated more than once, each time for a different
power domain.

apple/swift,e07e88706d873c34d5d939ac0126be65e3078f1c,Eliminate race in swift_bridgeErrorToNSError.,"

Huge thanks to John for noting that 'consume' didn't provide the
guarantees we wanted, and to Michael G. for getting a TSan build up
and running to identify/verify this race.

It's possible that this is overlay strict, and that we only need to
look at the domain to ensure that the code and userInfo are
visible. However, TSan seems to prefix the form in this patch, so
we'll be more conservative for now.

Fixes rdar://problem/27541751.

wikimedia/pywikibot-core,2091cf280f016908751787a7ad77675c757c2610,site.py: check if site is enabled for uploads,"

Fix Bug 69090: upload.py attempts uploads on wikis that
don't allow uploads.

Check APIError code to determine if Site is enabled for uploading.
Currently it is done and cached at first upload attempt.

Added also a helper function is_uploaddisabled() to determine if a site
has uploads enabled, based on a dummy upload attempt.
Throttle has been disabled for such request to speed up the query
(implementation taken from I80b2bba9e63832173d5b697db1f4ea419ca1122f).

google/llvm-propeller,92570718a86cc4c23108b596002114ab25857b14,[clangd] Mechanism to make update debounce responsive to rebuild speed.,"

Summary:
Currently we delay AST rebuilds by 500ms after each edit, to wait for
further edits. This is a win if a rebuild takes 5s, and a loss if it
takes 50ms.

This patch sets debouncepolicy = clamp(min, ratio * rebuild_time, max).
However it sets min = max = 500ms so there's no policy change or actual
customizability - will do that in a separate patch.

the user can call convenience methods in `gcloud.datastore` directly

goal is that in places like App Engine and Compute Engine, the
dataset ID can be implied without **any** user intervention.

Partially addresses #337.

Marcin Wojtas says:

====================
Armada 7k/8k PP2 ACPI support

I quickly resend the series, thanks to Antoine Tenart's remark,
who spotted !CONFIG_ACPI compilation issue after introducing
the new fwnode_irq_get() routine. Please see the details in the changelog
below and the 3/7 commit log.

mvpp2 driver can work with the ACPI representation, as exposed
on a public branch:
https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/edk2-open-platform/commits/marvell-armada-wip
It was compiled together with the most recent Tianocore EDK2 revision.
Please refer to the firmware build instruction on MacchiatoBin board:
http://wiki.macchiatobin.net/tiki-index.php?page=Build+from+source+-+UEFI+EDK+II

ACPI representation of PP2 controllers (withouth PHY support) can
be viewed in the github:
* MacchiatoBin:
https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/edk2-open-platform/blob/71ae395da1661374b0f07d1602afb1eee56e9794/Platforms/Marvell/Armada/AcpiTables/Armada80x0McBin/Dsdt.asl#L201

I will appreciate any comments or remarks.

Best regards,
Marcin

As we now have a name property components in the taskDef
model we can remove the remaining UI dependencies on the
previously redundant name storage within sched task meta info.
Although currently this only affected scheduled tasks it would,
once we also no longer store pool_name in sched scrub, also
arise similarly for scheduled scrubs. Proof of this function
was enacted by hand editing scrub meta db info to simulate
future removal of the pool_name element.
Also contains a fix for subtitle in task history showing

AppBannerManager currently retrieves page transition types from
WebContentsObserver::DidCommitProvisionalLoadForFrame. This is called
for every resource retrieved by a site. Instead, transition types should
be retrieved from the params passed into
WebContentsObserver::DidNavigateMainFrame, which is only called for
top-level navigations.

Different transition types are currently not scored differently in
triggering app banners, so this issue only manifests as continual
setting of the stored transition type. This fix ensures that any future
decision to distinguish by transition type uses the correct transitions.
Additionally, some tidying up of the class is undertaken, reordering
the implementation methods to match the header, removing an
extraneous unimplemented and uncalled method, and shifting the
WebContentsObserver overrides to private.

This is a byte-for-byte copy of the skein implementation found at:

  https://github.com/wernerd/Skein3Fish.git

Specifically, from the master branch at commit:

  00e925444c2c Merge pull request #4 from csm/master

The next commit will do the minimum necessary to build this code as a
module.

scalameta/scalameta,6f30fd2f89ce0c4ec8c104eda9f045f72893455e,Support cross-platform handling of Lit.Float/Double.,"

Scala.js has different runtime semantics for floats/double, and in
particular floats. For details, see

https://www.scala-js.org/doc/semantics.html#runtime-type-tests-are-based-on-values

This commit changes the AST of Lit.{Float,Double} to
accept a string as an argument instead of scala.Float/Double.

Benefits:
- full source code fidelity, if user typed `1.4f` in the code, all pretty
  printed version of that syntax tree will print as `1.4f`.

Caveats:
- `q""1.40f"".structure != q""1.4f"".structure` (was equal before).
- Lit.Float(""a"") throws NumberFormatException. Note, this runtime error
  case be guarded against by using quasiquotes.

Rehash can cause a steep 2X increase in memory usage. It is dangerous to
increase memory usage significantly before reserving it in memory
accounting system. This can lead to JVM OOM. We observed frequent full GCs
in production, which can be attributed to this root cause.  This patch
buffers unfinished page in the operator if the operator needs to rehash
the hash table when there is not enough memory. The operator will yield
and become blocked for memory allocation, and continue rehashing once
unblocked.

grivet/dpdk,792e749e92d585ed083c80ab5c15cf5203534ae9,net/mlx5: fix register usage in meter,"

Flow with meter will split to three subflows, the prefix subflow with
meter action do the color, the meter subflow  filter the packets, the
suffix subflow do all the left actions for packets pass the filter.
Both the color and the subflow match between prefix and suffix use the
register to store the tag.

For some of the NICs with meter color register share capability, it
only uses 8 LSB of the register for color, the left 24 MSB can be used
for flow id match between meter prefix subflow and suffix subflow.

Currently, one entire register is allocated for flow matching which
causes the NICs with limited registers don't have enough register for
other matching.

Add the meter color share capability checking to fix lacking of
registers issue.

Add bindings for TI Async External Memory Interface (AEMIF) controller.

The Async External Memory Interface (EMIF16/AEMIF) controller is intended to
provide a glue-less interface to a variety of asynchronous memory devices like
ASRA M, NOR and NAND memory. A total of 256M bytes of any of these memories
can be accessed via 4 chip selects with 64M byte access per chip select.

We are not encoding CS number in reg property, it's memory partition number.
The CS number is encoded for Davinci NAND node using standalone property
""ti,davinci-chipselect"" and we need to provide two memory ranges to it,
as result we can't encode CS number in ""reg"" for AEMIF child devices
(NAND/NOR/etc), as it will break bindings compatibility.

In this patch, NAND node is used just as an example of child node.

google/llvm-propeller,ddf71fc3708b9187fdfb38b086b1ee0d4e98825c,COFF: Initial implementation of Identical COMDAT Folding.,"

Identical COMDAT Folding (ICF) is an optimization to reduce binary
size by merging COMDAT sections that contain the same metadata,
actual data and relocations. MSVC link.exe and many other linkers
have this feature. LLD achieves on per with MSVC in terms produced
binary size with this patch.

This technique is pretty effective. For example, LLD's size is
reduced from 64MB to 54MB by enaling this optimization.

The algorithm implemented in this patch is extremely inefficient.
It puts all COMDAT sections into a set to identify duplicates.
Time to self-link with/without ICF are 3.3 and 320 seconds,
respectively. So this option roughly makes LLD 100x slower.
But it's okay as I wanted to achieve correctness first.
LLD is still able to link itself with this optimization.
I'm going to make it more efficient in followup patches.

Note that this optimization is *not* entirely safe. C/C++ require
different functions have different addresses. If your program
relies on that property, your program wouldn't work with ICF.
However, it's not going to be an issue on Windows because MSVC
link.exe turns ICF on by default. As long as your program works
with default settings (or not passing /opt:noicf), your program
would work with LLD too.

tprrt/linux-stable,b48845af0152d790a54b8ab78cc2b7c07485fc98,bpf: In bpf_task_fd_query use fget_task,"

Use the helper fget_task to simplify bpf_task_fd_query.

As well as simplifying the code this removes one unnecessary increment of
struct files_struct.  This unnecessary increment of files_struct.count can
result in exec unnecessarily unsharing files_struct and breaking posix
locks, and it can result in fget_light having to fallback to fget reducing
performance.

This simplification comes from the observation that none of the
callers of get_files_struct actually need to call get_files_struct
that was made when discussing[1] exec and posix file locks.

MariaDB/server,277697b81f5a3856a0fc7c7282810590cf0e5346,Bug#16346241 - SERVER CRASH IN ITEM_PARAM::QUERY_VAL_STR,"

Problem:-
Second execution of prepared statement for query with 
parameter in limit clause, causes an assert when using 
connectors (e.g., Connector C).  


Analysis:-
In prepared statement, LIMIT parameters can be
specified using '?' markers. Value for the parameter can
be supplied while executing the prepared statement.

Passing string, float or double values for LIMIT clause
works well from command-line client. That's because, while 
setting the LIMIT parameter value from a user-variable,
the value is converted to integer value.

However, when prepared statement is executed from other
interfaces as J connectors, or C applications etc,
the value for the parameters are sent to the server
with execute command. Each item in command has value and
the data TYPE. So, while setting parameter values
from this log, value is set to all the parameters
with the same data type as passed.
Here, we have the logic to convert the value to change the 
state and item_type if it is part of LIMIT parameter and 
its item_type is not INT.
But when we reset this parameter we save the item_type but change 
state. So on second execution we have old item_type but our state 
has been changed, which make us to use string type variable 
in Item_param::query_str_val(). This cause an assert.

Fix:
Instead of checking the item_type of the parameter, check for 
the state of the parameter. As state value are reset everytime
we execute the statement.

condensediffs had some memory issues. Even though we were using
QuerySet.iterator, it seems memory was still increasing far too much.

To work around this, we're using a couple tricks that we used in
loaddb and dumpdb. We're only operating on batches of 200 diffs at a
time, and are resetting queries and garbage-collecting after each batch.

The query resets shouldn't impact production installs, since DEBUG
should be False, but it's a precaution. We're also forcing DEBUG to be
False in the management command as well.

With these changes, memory still increases over time, to a degree, but
seems to stabilize. This is with a sample set of over 8200 diffs.

The HCI_BREDR naming is confusing since it actually stands for Primary
Bluetooth Controller. Which is a term that has been used in the latest
standard. However from a legacy point of view there only really have
been Basic Rate (BR) and Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). Recent versions of
Bluetooth introduced Low Energy (LE) and made this terminology a little
bit confused since Dual Mode Controllers include BR/EDR and LE. To
simplify this the name HCI_PRIMARY stands for the Primary Controller
which can be a single mode or dual mode controller.

segmentio/analytics-ios,2e6c57d4146ae2f25b5b372a430224de10319c54,Create HTTP requests on a background queue.,"

This refactors the internal implementation of the `sendData` to _create_
the HTTP requests on a new background queue. Note that this simply changes
the _creation_ of the request to the new background queue - the actual
execution was already on a background thread.

With this change, customers to add more complex logic in their connection
factories. e.g. a customer can use the connection factory to fetch a
token for a user, and attach that token to the request being made to by
the library to their proxy.

Previously, the creation would happen on the queueing thread. This
means that while the HTTP request was being _created_, events would not be
queued. By default, this is not a problem, the actual creation of the
request is a few ms at most. However, this assumes that the connection
factory customers might set only runs for a few ms. A long running connection
factory would have a chance of blocking the queueing thread for too long and
open a small window for data loss.

This opened up a slight chance that the integration would call flush
(for various reasons) while the HTTP request was being created
(particularly if the connection factory is slow). Hence we add a check to
verify that a request is not in progress before proceeding to create the
request. This is done with a boolean flag that is only read/updated on
the serialQueue.

Lastly, the code that sets the `sentAt` flag is now moved to inside the
HTTP Client. This is to move it closer to the time when the HTTP request
is actually made - otherwise a slow connection factory would cause the
server to think that the device timestamps are skewed.

apache/spark,2af5237fe889ddc0926ca7af8eab0fec5622ecbb,[SPARK-29918][SQL][FOLLOWUP][TEST] Fix arrayOffset in `RecordBinaryComparatorSuite`,"

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?

As mentioned in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26548#pullrequestreview-334345333, some test cases in `RecordBinaryComparatorSuite` use a fixed arrayOffset when writing to long arrays, this  could lead to weird stuff including crashing with a SIGSEGV.

This PR fix the problem by computing the arrayOffset based on `Platform.LONG_ARRAY_OFFSET`.

### How was this patch tested?
Tested locally. Previously, when we try to add `System.gc()` between write into long array and compare by RecordBinaryComparator, there is a chance to hit JVM crash with SIGSEGV like:
```
#
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#
#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007efc66970bcb, pid=11831, tid=0x00007efc0f9f9700

# Problematic frame:

#
# If you would like to submit a bug report, please visit:
#   http://bugreport.java.com/bugreport/crash.jsp
#
```
After the fix those test cases didn't crash the JVM anymore.

Closes #26939 from jiangxb1987/rbc.

tprrt/linux-stable,d8f9dfae49ce4ffb772dc10dd6578dc815b34c12,net: sched: allow flower to match vxlan options,"

This patch is to allow matching gbp option in vxlan.

The options can be described in the form GBP/GBP_MASK,
where GBP is represented as a 32bit hexadecimal value.
Different from geneve, only one option can be set. And
also, geneve options and vxlan options can't be set at
the same time.

  # ip link add name vxlan0 type vxlan dstport 0 external
  # tc qdisc add dev vxlan0 ingress
  # tc filter add dev vxlan0 protocol ip parent ffff: \
      flower \
        enc_src_ip 10.0.99.192 \
        enc_dst_ip 10.0.99.193 \
        enc_key_id 11 \
        vxlan_opts 01020304/ffffffff \
        ip_proto udp \
        action mirred egress redirect dev eth0

v1->v2:
  - add .strict_start_type for enc_opts_policy as Jakub noticed.
  - use Duplicate instead of Wrong in err msg for extack as Jakub
    suggested.

blkdev_issue_zeroout() printed a warning if a device failed a discard or
write same request despite advertising support for these. That's fine
for SCSI since we'll disable these commands if we get an error back from
the disk saying that they are not supported. And consequently the
warning only gets printed once.

There are other types of block devices that support discard, however,
and these may return -EOPNOTSUPP for each command but leave discard
enabled in the queue limits. This will cause a warning message for every
blkdev_issue_zeroout() invocation.

Remove the offending warning messages.

Fix comes from rabbitmq:

> On December 1st, 2018 (GMT) all repositories under the RabbitMQ account on PackageCloud
will be switched to use the new signing keys. RabbitMQ users who install packages
from PackageCloud must import the new signing keys before the migration.
The recommended way of doing that is by re-running PackageCloud setup
scripts (RabbitMQ, Erlang). Signing keys can be downloaded and imported directly
as well (RabbitMQ, Erlang). If the new keys are not imported, package installation
will start failing with a signature verification error.

google/llvm-propeller,b25187adfbe3213c99048d58a94f242f95db7eac,[libclang] Fix LibclangReparseTest.FileName when TMPDIR is set to a symlink,"

Fix testing of clang_File_tryGetRealPathName() in
LibclangReparseTest.FileName when executing in an environment which has
TMPDIR set to a symbolic link that points to an actual directory. The
test would fail because the name returned by
clang_File_tryGetRealPathName() has the symlink resolved but the test
compared it to the original filename of a temporary file.

The patch addresses the problem by checking only that the value returned
by clang_File_tryGetRealPathName() ends with ""main.cpp"".

Additionally, the patch makes the previous assertion in the test that
checks result of clang_getFileName() stricter. It newly verifies that
the name returned by the function is exactly same as what was given to
clang_parseTranslationUnit()/clang_getFile().

until Dom0 registers it explicitly after ACPI parser recognizes it as
a reserved resource in DSDT. Having it reserved in E820 is not
mandatory according to ""PCI Firmware Specification, rev 3.2"" (par. 4.1.2)
and firmware is free to keep a hole in E820 in that place. Xen doesn't know
what exactly is inside this hole since it lacks full ACPI view of the
platform therefore it's potentially harmful to access MCFG region
without additional checks as some machines are known to provide
inconsistent information on the size of the region.

Now xen_mcfg_late() runs after acpi_init() which is too late as some basic
PCI enumeration starts exactly there as well. Trying to register a device
prior to MCFG reservation causes multiple problems with PCIe extended
capability initializations in Xen (e.g. SR-IOV VF BAR sizing). There are
no convenient hooks for us to subscribe to so register MCFG areas earlier
upon the first invocation of xen_add_device(). It should be safe to do once
since all the boot time buses must have their MCFG areas in MCFG table
already and we don't support PCI bus hot-plug.

|HTMLToken::Attribute::value| should be used as |String(value)| or
|StringImpl::create8BitIfPossible(value)|.
- |value.data()| is nullptr for attributes with no values, and such |value|
  should be converted to the empty string (WTF::String or AtomicString),
  because the null string is used for absence of an attribute.
- |String(value)| and |StringImpl::create8BitIfPossible(value)| converts
  |value| with null |value.data()| into the empty string.

However, |AtomicString(value)| converts |value| with null |value.data()| into
the null string.
This is done in AtomicHTMLToken, so this CL fixes it.

Also, this CL
- Adds unit tests for attributes with empty value,
- Adds CORE_EXPORT to classes/function needed by the unit tests, and
- Creates AtomicHTMLToken.cpp and moves implementation of AtomicHTMLToken from
  HTMLTokenizer.cpp.

When doing a fork (new VM), the new task has a mirror image of the
parent's stack, so keeps the same live register windows etc.
However when doing a clone with CLONE_VM, keeping the same VM
(eg. when creating a new thread), the child starts afresh on a new
stack -- it cannot share any part of the parent stack.  It
especially cannot have the same live AR windows as the parent,
otherwise it will overwrite the parent stack on overflow, likely
causing corruption.  (and so it did...)

Effectively, the register windows need to be spilled.
Turns out it's much easier to simply not copy parent register
windows when CLONE_VM is set.

On the A64, the MMC module clocks are fixed in the new timing mode,
i.e. they do not have a bit to select the mode. These clocks have
a 2x divider somewhere between the clock and the MMC module.

To be consistent with other SoCs supporting the new timing mode,
we model the 2x divider as a fixed post-divider on the MMC module
clocks.

This patch adds the post-dividers to the MMC clocks.

nwjs/chromium.src,60879704bfb1cb2deb2f2f945132b4552c8a2ea7,Alternate NTP Mac: Show overlay at fixed position,"

Previously the overlay was shown at the bottom of the toolbar. The height of
the bookmark bar changes if the bookmark bar is attached. This meant that the
overlay would change positions (relative to the omnibox) depending on the
bookmark bar's attached state.

With this CL we now show the overlay at the fixed offset from the omnibox.

One side effect of this is that the bottom of the toolbar can no longer act
as a separator for the overlay. I've changed the overlay to draw its own
separator.

* Add monkeypatch to Rspec suite to fix lacking test method for new method in Rails.

Rails 4.1.14.1 introducted a new method for finding render templates and
files. Rspec-rails implements these methods. Since the new method had not
been implemented in Rspec yet, I've added this temporary monkeypatch until
a new version of rspec-rails is released and we can upgrade to it.

See https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/issues/1532 for discussion around
the issue. And https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/pull/1533 for the
current PR open to resolve it in the gem.

* Change specs from testing a 404 template render to a 404 response code

Rspec-Rails 3.1.0 doesn't like testing the rendering of templates for
Rails 4.1.14.1 with Rails' introduction of some fixes to template paths.

In these tests for 404 responses, I've replaced the expectations of a certain
template rendering with expectations of 404 status code. May circle back
and add template rendering tests back in once Rails and rspec-rails get
along again.

tprrt/linux-stable,8f85c0af2388d575a598d2695319ccb7e1b5523c,i2c/mpc: Drop NO_IRQ,"

Drop NO_IRQ as 0 is the preferred way to describe 'no irq'
(http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/21/221). This change is safe, as the driver is
only used on powerpc, where NO_IRQ is 0 anyhow.

tprrt/linux-stable,20d190473328b90755eb2434cf2d26b73a53ef23,kconfig: Fix streamline_config to read multi line deps in Kconfig files,"

I noticed that some Kconfig files have multi line dependencies
that continue with a backslash. Those dependencies on the next
line will be missed by streamline_config.

For example:

config CS89x0
	tristate ""CS89x0 support""
	depends on NET_ETHERNET && (ISA || EISA || MACH_IXDP2351 \
		|| ARCH_IXDP2X01 || MACH_MX31ADS)

The ""|| ARCH_IXDP2X01 || MACH_MX31ADS)"" will not be processed.

This patch adds code to handle this case.

tprrt/linux-stable,421ca868ea3b7c1ca1a541ed6dff3c101a563b95,perf/x86/intel: Implement LBR callstack context synchronization,"

Implement intel_pmu_lbr_swap_task_ctx() method updating counters
of the events that requested LBR callstack data on a sample.

The counter can be zero for the case when task context belongs to
a thread that has just come from a block on a futex and the context
contains saved (lbr_stack_state == LBR_VALID) LBR register values.

For the values to be restored at LBR registers on the next thread's
switch-in event it swaps the counter value with the one that is
expected to be non zero at the previous equivalent task perf event
context.

Swap operation type ensures the previous task perf event context
stays consistent with the amount of events that requested LBR
callstack data on a sample.

        remove the source.
        (_wrap_g_main_loop_run): push/pop the currently running
        main loop.

        * gobject/pygobject-private.h: add a pointer for the
        source to PyGMainLoop.

openstack/nova,c943cbbc40654827f537773a90d77577a54dbe0b,ensure DatabaseFixture removes db on cleanup,"

The DatabaseFixture was previously just ensuring that tests which used
it had a clean database when they started. It did not ensure there was
no working database around when it wasn't being used, so tests which
leaked into the database might pass even if they were listed as a
NoDBTest, because there was an in memory test db from a prior run.

This adds a cleanup path to the fixture which blows away the db at the
end of the test (which itself is tested). There were 46 tests which
failed when we got this isolation correct, and this changes all those
test classes containing those tests to require a db. Many of these
could have narrower fixes, but this returns us to an isolated state.

This adds pci_enable_msi_range(), which supersedes the pci_enable_msi()
and pci_enable_msi_block() MSI interfaces.

It also adds pci_enable_msix_range(), which supersedes the
pci_enable_msix() MSI-X interface.

The old interfaces have three categories of return values:

    negative: failure; caller should not retry
    positive: failure; value indicates number of interrupts that *could*
	have been allocated, and caller may retry with a smaller request
    zero: success; at least as many interrupts allocated as requested

It is error-prone to handle these three cases correctly in drivers.

The new functions return either a negative error code or a number of
successfully allocated MSI/MSI-X interrupts, which is expected to lead to
clearer device driver code.

pci_enable_msi(), pci_enable_msi_block() and pci_enable_msix() still exist
unchanged, but are deprecated and may be removed after callers are updated.

GNOME/mutter,502da973eb0ef67a6f279c5c0c87a12fcda169f5,window: free close dialog before unmanaging window from compositor,"

When an application stops responding, the shell darkens its windows.

If a window from a not-responding application gets unmanaged
then the shell will currently throw an exception trying to retrieve
the now-dissociated window actor.

That leads to a ""stuck window"" ghost on screen and a traceback
in the log.

This commit addresses the problem by making sure the effect is cleaned
up before the actor is disocciated from its window.

Summary:
Lit expects a test status line (kTestLineRE) before a verbose log start marker (kTestVerboseLogStartRE).

    FAIL: LLDB :: asdf (9 of 20)
    *** TEST 'LLDB :: asdf' FAIL ***

If the test status line is malformed, LitTestCommand has an exception at outLineReceived, and testInfoFinished because lastTestResult is None.

    FAIL: LLDB :: asdf
    *** TEST 'LLDB :: asdf' FAIL ***

Another case of mismatched status/log lines skips the log entry.

This patch handles lastTestResult is None, and skips the log entry.

Test Plan: Unit test 'test_missing_lastresult' shows the before and after effects of the change.

to be explicit, and because a DFA is a subclass of an NFA, whose proper name should minimally include ""finite word"", to avoid confusion (there exists enough inconsistency of terminology in the literature).

An FWA data structure does not differ (at least for now) from a BA, but their semantics are different, so better separate them.
This becomes apparent if in the future a method ""to_ltl"" is added to infinite-word automata.
Of course whether this should be a method or a function is another debate and since it involves interfaces, e.g.,to ltl2ba, that will live elsewhere, such a method would cause cyclic imports, so it seems appropriate that it should be a function in another tulip sub package (transys doesn't know anything about formulas).

nwjs/chromium.src,aa5c49175702f57438c939a7e4796ff19de4b681,cc: Remove SetMemoryPolicy from OutputSurface and Display.,"

This method is plumbed through the Display but nothing ever actually
goes there. The only usage of this is:
1) WebView changes the policy based on SyncCompositorMsg_SetMemoryPolicy
but it does so from SynchronousCompositorOutputSurface by calling the
OutputSurfaceClient (LayerTreeHostImpl) directly.
2) CompositorOutputSurface sets a limit when using software compositing.

Instead of 2, pass both gpu and software limits in the LayerTreeSettings,
and have LayerTreeHostImpl use the software limits directly when given
a software output surface. And remove the plumbing through Display and
replace it with a NOTREACHED.

This means we don't have to support the method at all on the
""OutputSurfaceClient"" that Display uses, only the one that
LayerTreeHostImpl uses.

Left a comment on OutputSurfaceClient::SetMemoryPolicy() that it is
only used by WebView now. crbug.com/499004 suggests that the WebView
usage could also be replaced with something else. WebView seems to
only be changing the bytes part of the limit, so probably the method
only needs to take that, and I feel like the implementation in
LayerTreeHostImpl could probably be cleaned up some more yet also.

Modified the StackID class to no rely on needing the start PC for the current
function/symbol since we can use the SymbolContextScope to uniquely identify
that, unless there is no symbol context scope. In that case we can rely upon
the current PC value. This saves the StackID from having to calculate the 
start PC when the StackFrame::GetStackID() accessor is called.

Also improved the StackID less than operator to correctly handle inlined stack
frames in the same stack.

Some attributes being used in the phpunit configuration files, namely
failOnRisky and failOnWarning were introduced in phpunit 5.2.0. The
Composer configuration shows that tests should run with old versions of
phpunit, but phpunit only validates the configuration against the XSD
since phpunit 7.2.0.
These changes can be tested as follows:

wget http://schema.phpunit.de/5.2/phpunit.xsd

find src -name phpunit.xml.dist| xargs xmllint --schema phpunit.xsd  1>/dev/null

nwjs/chromium.src,d6fffa909e840af681a223f53a2c19dd80942a2d,Experiment with hiding <script>'s 'nonce' content attribute.,"

Nonces are valuable, as they allow script execution. It would be lovely if
we could raise the bar on exfiltration to reduce the effectiveness of some
of the attacks noted at http://sebastian-lekies.de/csp/bypasses.php.

One mechanism that might be effective against some kinds of exfiltration is
to stop treating the 'nonce' content attribute as the source of truth, instead
pulling the nonce value into an internal slot on the HTMLScriptElement at
parse-time. That prevents exfiltration via attribute leakage, mitigating the
effect of vectors like `[nonce^=ab]` and `content: attr(nonce)`
(http://cspnonce-test.appspot.com/exploit?reset=1 and
http://sebastian-lekies.de/csp/social_engineering.php, respectively). We also
clear the nonce after use (""number used _once_"", right?) which mitigates the
style of attack hinted at in https://sirdarckcat.github.io/csp/fakexss.html
(though that specific issue is also resolved by fixing the browser bug in
https://codereview.chromium.org/2618323002).

Here, we're replacing the nonce content attribute with '[Replaced]', as that
gives developers a hint at what's going on (e.g. in devtools), but we could
pretty easily drop that in the future and just make it a devtools feature
entirely. Not sure what the right thing to do is..

This prototype just effects `<script>`; once we decide on reasonable behavior,
we can extend it to `<link>` and `<style>`.

This patch makes |createLegacyEditingPosition()| not to allow legacy editing
position which is middle of position at middle of node where editing
ignoring content, |editingIgnoreContent(node)| returns true, to simplify
|PositionAlgorithm<Strategy>|, avoid to use legacy code for improving code
health.

For node which returns true for |editingIgnoreContent(node)|, e.g. SELECT
element, editing functions don't place a caret and change child nodes.

Call sites of |createLegacyEditingPosition()|, which create a position at
middle of a node returns false |editingIgnoreContent(node)|, are invalid, we
need to fix such call sites not to create legacy editing position.

This patch has potential risks that it causes assertion for buggy code which
uses positions at middle of editing ignore content. However, we've never found
such code so far. Once we hit assertion, we have sample HTML and fix it.

This patch is a preparation of getting rid of legacy editing position,
following patch will remove |m_isLegacyEditingPosition|, rename
|deprecatedEditingOffset()| and |createLegacyEditingPosition()|.

libvirt/libvirt-python,d0ac75bb9c711ee2805aaa976827ea9401592193,virStream: Use larger buffer for sendAll/recvAll methods,"

There are four methods which receive/send entire stream
(sendAll(), recvAll(), sparseSendAll() and sparseRecvAll()). All
these have an intermediary buffer which is either filled by
incoming stream and passed to a user provided callback to handle
the data, or the other way round - user fills it with data they
want to send and the buffer is handed over to virStream.

But the buffer is incredibly small which leads to smaller packets
being sent and thus increased overhead. What we can do is to use
the same buffer as their C counterparts do (e.g.
virStreamSendAll()) - they all use VIR_NET_MESSAGE_LEGACY_PAYLOAD_MAX
long buffer (which is the maximum size of a stream packet we
send) - this is almost exactly 256KiB (it's 256KiB - 24B for the
header).

* Replacing sox.file_info calls with soundfile.info(...).duration calls (#110)

* switching to soundfile for checking duration speeds things up

* pysoundfile has moved to soundfile on pip, updating setup.py

* install only one version of soundfile...

* Using Soundfile I/O operations + build_array functions from PySox (#111)

This changes the mechanisms within the `_generate_audio` function to use SoundFile for I/O and to use the build_array function from `sox` 1.4.0b0.

* Switching to using ""build_array"" + soundfile operations.

* Using soundfile ops + build_array gives a performance boost.

* np.pad in python 2.7 requires mode as a positional argument.

* source -> event in _generate_audio for structures holding numpy arrays

* cleaning up a stray comment

* adding a comment about needing both convert and set_output_format.

* adding back in a line for cleaner git diff

* Changing nomenclature, cleaning some stuff up.

* Had a duplicate line. Fixed.

* Removing context manager that was used for an easier CR.

* Changing tfm.fade operation to a numpy operation. (#117)

Fade operation happens directly on the numpy arrays containing the audio samples now, rather than going through sox.

* Changing fade to equiv numpy op

* Switching to using fade in-memory gives slightly more speed.

* Fixing some multichannel bugs when switching to in-memory ops. (#118)

* Fixing some multichannel bugs.

* Updating the test case, sidestepping multi-channel regression data for now.

* Updating test for trimming soundscapes to take into account saving isolated sources

* Pushing the actual fix to generate_from_jams.

* Updating changelog and bumping version

* Using TemporaryDirectory in the test case now, rather than relying on the whims of tempfile

* Raising atol in a test from 1e-5 to 1e-4.

kythe/kythe,124a010a61e3449db40d7563678acd031037bebe,Fix the protobuf dependency on zlib.,"

Summary:
When I updated the protobuf rules in D2122, I also inadvertently introduced a
dependency bug. In particular, I did not plumb through the correct zlib deps,
so that protobuf built using the ambient system-installed zlib instead of the
one we build in Bazel.

This change binds our //third_party/zlib rule as an external dependency and
fixes up the BUILD file for protobuf to use it properly.

Addresses T287.

These are no longer used. Everything has been migrated to
ScopedIPCSupport, so the implementations of those functions are now
merged into ScopedIPCSupport impl.

Just some minor cleanup, pardon the dust.

A problem with unmounting the dev filesystem in Ubuntu images caused
the umount of the /dev bind mount to fail, which left it there to be
removed during the mv -t step, causing the build host's /dev to be
wiped out.

The lazy umount will detach it from the filesystem hierarchy and then
clean up the mount reference later.

There was a small chance that this could lead to pages running in a broken state, where ONLY that connection failed and everything else worked. This was accidentally fixed by narrowing the exceptions we continue on in D16489.

However, this ""fix"" meant that users no longer got helpful setup instructions. Instead:

  - Keep throwing these exceptions: it's bad to continue if we've failed to connect to the database.
  - However, catch them and turn them into setup errors.
  - Share all the setup code so these errors and setup check errors work the same way.

Test Plan:
  - Intentionally broke `mysql.host` and `mysql.pass`.
  - Loaded pages.
  - Got good setup errors.
  - Hit normal setup errors too.
  - Put everything back.
  - Swapped into cluster mode.
  - Intentionally broke cluster mode, saw failover to readonly.

openstack/rally,348493e191b3a28d62bf492d99b46f1963856744,Add caching to osclients.Clients,"

Here we add caching capabilities to the osclients.Clients class, so that any
openstack client, created once, gets stored in the cache and is immediately
returned in case of future calls to the corresponding method of Clients.
This is needed for implementing lazy OpenStack clients for temporary users
where it is not convenient to store clients in Scenario classes but making
use of caching in osclients.Clients makes sense.

Summary:
We determine the REX prefix used by instruction in `determineREXPrefix`,
and this value is used in `emitMemModRMByte' and used as the return
value of `emitOpcodePrefix`.

Before this patch, REX was passed as reference to `emitPrefixImpl`, it
is strange and not necessary, e.g, we have to write
```
bool Rex = false;
emitPrefixImpl(CurOp, CurByte, Rex, MI, STI, OS);
```
in `emitPrefix` even if `Rex` will not be used.

So we let HasREX be the return value of `emitPrefixImpl`. The HasREX is passed
from `emitREXPrefix` to  `emitOpcodePrefix` and then to
`emitPrefixImpl`. This makes sense since REX is a kind of opcode prefix
and of course is a prefix.

There was a duplicate code to create TYPELIB from List<String>:
- In typelib() and mysql_prepare_create_table(), which was used to initialize
  table fields.
- create_typelib() and sp_prepare_create_field(), which was used to initialize
  SP variables.
create_typelib() was incomplete and didn't check for wrong SET values.

Fix:
- Moving the code from create_typelib() and mysql_prepare_create_field()
  to news methods Column_definition::create_interval_from_interval_list()
  and Column_definition::prepare_interval_field().
- Moving the code from calculate_interval_lengths() in sql_table.cc
  to a new method Column_definition::calculate_interval_lengths(), as it's now
  needed only in Column_definition::create_interval_from_interval_list()
- Reusing the new method Column_definition::prepare_interval_field() in both
  mysql_prepare_create_table() and sp_prepare_create_field(), instead of the
  old duplicate code pieces
- Removing global functions typelib() and create_typelib()

In earlier iterations of the i915-perf driver we had a number of
callbacks/hooks from other parts of the i915 driver to e.g. notify us
when a legacy context was pinned and these could run asynchronously with
respect to the stream file operations and might also run in atomic
context.

dev_priv->perf.hook_lock had been for serialising access to state needed
within these callbacks, but as the code has evolved some of the hooks
have gone away or are implemented to avoid needing to lock any state.

The remaining use of this lock was actually redundant considering how
the gen7 oacontrol state used to be updated as part of a context pin
hook.

Previously when pushing the GLES2 context with an onscreen framebuffer
it would just call bind_onscreen. This actually binds it with Cogl's
context so presumably the context isolation wasn't working properly.
This patch splits out bind_onscreen to have a second function called
bind_onscreen_with_context that explicitly takes the EGL context to
use. Cogl now uses this when pushing the GLES2 context.

Solution: Modify the ctrlspace extension to call the new APIs

The statusline work fine but the custom ctrlspace function
somehow/somewhere gets overridden and I could not figure out where.
Therefore the user must add

let g:CtrlSpaceStatuslineFunction = ""airline#extensions#ctrlspace#statusline()""

Problem: Ctrlspace 5.0 does not integrate well into tabline
Solution: Write a tabline extensions for ctrlspace 5.0.

During a reset, we may skip over completed requests and lost
context-switch interrupts. Following the reset, we may then may end up
with no active requests in the ELSP (and so do not resubmit to restart
the engine), but have a queue of requests ready for execution. This is
unlikely, it requires the last request to complete after the hang is
detected, but not impossible. The outcome of this is that the engine
stalls, possibly leading to full ring and indefinite wait under
struct_mutex, eventually leading to a full driver hang.

Alternatively, we can solve this by unsubmitting the incomplete requests
and just kickstarting the tasklet. Michał has patches for that, which I
initially disliked due to the extra complexity, but the complexity of
this ""simple"" restart is growing...

freerangerouting/frr,e5d1e72daaf5775e4bf67d812553d4fd8775791a,bgpd: Upon interface up (update) only kick-off non-Established peers,"

Any interface flags/parameter change (e.g., MTU, PROMISC flag change) is
notified by zebra to clients as an ""up"" event. BGP literally treats this
as the interface coming up and kicks all neighbors on that interface (i.e.,
directly connected peers). When doing so for IPv4 peers on the interface
(numbered or unnumbered /30-/31) or IPv6 numbered peers, peers that may
already be Established are also flapped; when doing so for IPv6 unnumbered
peers (classic 'neighbor swpX interface' scenario with no configured IP
address on interface), only peers not in Established state are processed.

This patch fixes the code to ensure that in all cases, only non-Established
peers are kicked.

facebook/buck,b54c58b6fb4889ca732a3f498d604373ccc9ddcc,Introduce basic support for react native code.,"

Summary:
Here's how you use the new rule in a BUCK file:
```
LIBRARY_SRCS = glob(['Library/**/*.js'])
APP_SRCS = glob(['Apps/Groups/**/*.js'])
android_react_native_library(
  name = 'groups',
  srcs = LIBRARY_SRCS + APP_SRCS,
  entry_path = 'Apps/Groups/index.ios.js',
  bundle_name = 'GroupsBundle.js', // This is the file name of the output bundle.
  deps = [...],
)
```
Additionally, you specify the path to the JS packager in `.buckconfig`:
```
[react-native]
  packager = Libraries/FBReactKit/js/deps_resolver.js
```

When Buck builds up the action graph, for each `react_native_library` rule in
the target graph (i.e. BUCK files), it emits another build rule - `ReactNativeDeps`,
which calls into the dependency resolver, passing it paths to the JS entry point,
and output file (which will contain the transitive dependencies). It parses this
output, and hashes the files in the output, so that Buck can skip running the
bundling step if none of the inputs (actual inputs) have changed.

Test Plan: Integration tests.

zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr,128dcbbe13eac92a76b72bdeb7095a790f3b695f,kernel event logger: add possibility to use custom timestamp,"

By default, kernel event logger is using the system timer. But on
some platforms where the timer driver maintains the system timer
cycle accumulator in software, such as ones using the LOAPIC timer,
the system timer behavior leads to timestamp errors. For example,
the timer interrupt is logged with a wrong timestamp since the HW
timer value has been reset (periodic mode) but accumulated value not
updated yet (done later in the ISR).

This patch is adding the possibility to register a timer callback
function that will be used by the kernel event logger. For example,
on Quark SE, this allows using RTC or AON counter which accuracy is
sufficient and behavior more straight forward compared to system
timer.

One of our important client's SKP shows that this could improve one of
their janky frame by 20ms. This also improves our
flutter_gallery__transition_perf's worst frame time by ~20ms.

On the other hand, 15ms has been added to the start-up latency. I guess
it's a little faster to compile the shader on the start-up because we're
compiling a lot of shaders there and the CPU cache must be hot.

Add compiled lp55231 code snippets to allow display certain patterns
when booting the device with the recovery button pressed.

As soon as the press is detected, the low intensify solid white
pattern is enabled. Holding recovery button long enough causes the
device transition between the wipeout requested and recovery requested
states, with the appropriate changes in the displayed pattern.

The patch also includes the source code for the LED controller as well
as instructions on how to compile and modify the code to result in
different colors, intensities, blink periods and duty cycles.

     recovery button pressed, observe the changes in the LED display
     pattern while the device progresses through the boot sequence.

Linaro/test-definitions,e214f7c8dc9d4a518239db171c65fa470922ed89,android: added lava-android-test wrapper,"

The lava-test-shell wrapper around lava-android-test
allows to execute the lava-android-test from the KVM device
type in LAVA which acts as a host. With this approach
it is possible to controll the host environment and for example
use different Java versions with different Android CTS branches.

The test wrapper JSON fragment follows:
{
    ""command"": ""lava_test_shell"",
    ""parameters"": {
        ""role"": ""host"",
        ""testdef_repos"": [
            {
                ""git-repo"": ""git://git.linaro.org/qa/test-definitions.git"",
                ""parameters"": {
                    ""TEST_NAME"": ""cts"",
                    ""TEST_PARAMS"": ""--package android.bionic --timeout 1800 --disable-reboot""
                },
                ""testdef"": ""android/lava-android-test-host.yaml""
            }
        ],
        ""timeout"": 7200
    }
},
{
    ""command"": ""lava_test_shell"",
    ""parameters"": {
        ""role"": ""target"",
        ""testdef_repos"": [
            {
                ""git-repo"": ""git://git.linaro.org/qa/test-definitions.git"",
                ""parameters"": {
                    ""TEST_NAME"": ""cts"",
                    ""TEST_PARAMS"": ""--package android.bionic --timeout 1800 --disable-reboot""
                },
                ""testdef"": ""android/lava-android-test-target.yaml""
            }
        ],
        ""timeout"": 7200
    }
}

lava-android-test-host.yaml and lava-android-test-target.yaml take
TEST_NAME and TEST_PARAMS. These have to be the same for each pair
of test shells. Optionally lava-android-test-host.yaml takes
JAVA_PACKAGE parameter which is used to define the Java version
running on host.

Automattic/wp-calypso,68cd492e4d1ba8cce6891e2a401060142c312786,Add missing expect assertions to wechat,"

Follow-up to #28142.

I split this fix off into its own PR as it looks like it has broken
logic around showing the chat button to business users.

Changes:
- Unittest expect usage fixed
- Chat button logic fixed
- Showing the chat button uncovered misuse of css classes
- Fixed class wrapping so things display per credit cart payment box
- Reworked / improved tests checking for correct class usage, a bit
brittle but an improvement.

This was temporarily necessary in the past because we didn't have the logic that downloads actual *merge base* stats.

We do have that now as part of the Danger script. So we can remove this.

tprrt/linux-stable,9905ce8ad7b79dddd23c7b4753d0b2cdb65bde3c,ftrace/recordmcount: Avoid STT_FUNC symbols as base on ARM,"

While find_secsym_ndx often finds the unamed local STT_SECTION, if a
section has only one function in it, the ARM toolchain generates the
STT_FUNC symbol before the STT_SECTION, and recordmcount finds this
instead.

This is problematic on ARM because in ARM ELFs, ""if a [STT_FUNC] symbol
addresses a Thumb instruction, its value is the address of the
instruction with bit zero set (in a relocatable object, the section
offset with bit zero set)"".  This leads to incorrect mcount addresses
being recorded.

Fix this by not using STT_FUNC symbols as the base on ARM.

Instead of recursive automake with subdirs, we're now using non-
recursive automake using (recursive) includes.

This should speed up parallel builds because these aren't blocked
across subdirectory boundaries anymore now. Dependency change
detection and therefore subsequent partial builds are also faster with
a non-recursive setup.

On the downside, the gitstamp hackery had to be reorganized, because
build order can't be predicted anymore now.

CMake building is currently still broken as well.

chromium/chromium,c500339d37c0b3c682ab1af1521020df83b9a334,[iOS] Only present when the presentation context is active.,"

Previously, when the OverlayPresentationContext's coordinator is reset,
the presented UI was dismissed without notifying the presenter.  This
CL updates the implementation to have OverlayPresenter drive the
dismissal when the coordinator is reset.  This allows for the presenter
to be aware of all presentation/dismissal events so that its observers
can be notified when they occur (e.g. at the end of the tab grid =>
BVC transition animation).

To pipe this information back to OverlayPresenter, the presentation
context exposes IsActive(), which describes whether the context is
currently able to present.  When a coordinator is provided to the
context implementation, it notifies the presenter via observation that
it has become active, which triggers presentation.  When the coordinator
is reset to nil upon the BVC leaving the window, the presenter is
again notified via observation that the context is deactivating, which
triggers dismissal.

bazelbuild/bazel,0cdd71fe9782c7817fc1e0294285699fb4db8040,Take windows junctions into account with --watchfs,"

Related PR: #11334 I enabled --watchfs for windows under --experimental_windows_watchfs.

Related issues: #11619:
1. (infinite) recursion occurs on the convenience symlinks when they are created while watch is active. This also causes a delay on the first bazel invocation after the symlinks are created.
2. quite often an overflow warning occurs `WARNING: Overflow when watching local filesystem for changes...`. I think this is because the watcher also watches the bazel-* symlinks with many file changes due to being output directories.

The reason that this behavior is different on windows seems to be that the convenience symlinks are actually created as junctions. I have tried changed this logic to creating actually directory symlinks which seemed to resolve the issues. This however could be a breaking change on some systems because creating symlinks requires more privileges than creating junctions.

~~Therefore I propose the following changes:~~
~~1. Watch the root directory non-recursively. As it's done on non windows systems.~~
~~2. Watch each direct sub-directory recursively. Excluding junctions.~~

~~The downside of this approach is that the convenience symlinks must be at the root of the workspace. When using --symlink_prefix with a sub-directory (which is the case for in the linked issue) both issues would still occur.~~

I have updated the PR to reflect my comment below because this also resolves the above mentioned downside and is a simpler solution. I have tested several scenarios with regards to the folder locking but was able to delete workspace folders from explorer, ide and cli every time.

Closes #12054.

Progress toward #1107

Rather than printing suggestions out to the console, I think it actually makes
more sense to include them in the code. This should make them really hard to
miss and be especially useful for the use case of doing a large conversion and
then going through each file as a follow-up task. I added a `disableSuggestions`
flag to disable this behavior if people want.

For now, the `disableSuggestions` is always set to true from the CLI, meaning
the feature can't be accessed normally now; it's just exposed to tests. I'll
change it to false by default soon along with all of the other breaking changes.",False,,,,,,,comsum_random_batch_12_july_2021,-1,False

We currently allow changing the mq flag (IFF_MULTI_QUEUE) for a persistent
device. This will result a mismatch between the number the queues in netdev and
tuntap. This is because we only allocate a 1q netdevice when IFF_MULTI_QUEUE was
not specified, so when we set the IFF_MULTI_QUEUE and try to attach more queues
later, netif_set_real_num_tx_queues() may fail which result a single queue
netdevice with multiple sockets attached.

Solve this by disallowing changing the mq flag for persistent device.

PrerenderManager will eventually be moved to components. To that end,
introduce a delegate interface which will also be moved to components,
and a Chrome implementation of this interface where we'll keep the
chrome specific logic.

This removes the following dependencies from PrerenderManager:
CookieSettingsFactory
LoadingPredictor
LoadingPredictorFactory
tab_util

and removes two unused headers.

Currently, the mcount callers are found with a perl script that does
an objdump on every file in the kernel. This is a C version of that
same code which should increase the performance time of compiling
the kernel with dynamic ftrace enabled.

meta-raspberrypi carries U-Boot patches to support RPi4, and these
patches are only applied when building 'raspberrypi4' machine. For this
reason we can not have one integration patch for both RPi3 and RPi4 as it
will not apply when building for a RPi3 target.

We have to split out the RPi4 support in a individual patch that is only
applied when buildingfor RPi4.

This will sync-up in future releases once RPi4 support is part of U-Boot
upstream code.

With this change a more meaningful exception is thrown if a site could
not be imported for unknown reasons.
Besides this slightly improves the ``site:import`` command to give
feedback about the imported site on success.

This also adds some cosmetic and non-functional cleanups in order to
increase readabilty and IDE support:

* Import FQN where applicable
* Reduce nesting in ``SiteImportService::importFromFile()``
* Remove unused import statements
* Whitespace fixes

elogind/elogind,84343de19cf997ed0b8288ec1ff5b1d33c265993,basic/log: always ignore errno from the enviornment (#8841),"

This extends the change done in b29f6480ec to other logging functions.

This actually fixes some bugs in callers of log_struct(), for example
config_parse_alias() called 'return log_syntax(..., 0, ...)' which could result
in a bogus non-zero return value.

Calls to log_object() and log_format_iovec() — which is only used by
server_driver_message() — appear correct.

Now that the core vt code knows how to preserve unicode values for each
displayed character, it is then possible to let user space access it via
/dev/vcs*.

Unicode characters are presented as 32 bit values in native endianity
via the /dev/vcsu* devices, mimicking the simple /dev/vcs* devices.
Unicode with attributes (similarly to /dev/vcsa*) is not supported at
the moment.

Data is available only as long as the console is in UTF-8 mode. ENODATA
is returned otherwise.

This was tested with the latest development version (to become
version 5.7) of BRLTTY. Amongst other things, this allows ⠋⠕⠗ ⠞⠓⠊⠎
⠃⠗⠁⠊⠇⠇⠑⠀⠞⠑⠭⠞⠀to appear directly on braille displays regardless of the
console font being used.

Though it's kinda annoying, this is probably the only reasonable solution given that for a sufficient volume of filesystem changes, the database simply can't keep up. For example, removing a file is very quick for the filesystem, but quite laborious for tup (possibly a case for optimization). Doing things such as 'rm -rf large_tree' will cause events to get dropped, so the monitor gets out of sync. When this happens, the monitor will clear out its dircache and inotify queue, then re-read the tree from the top.

1352: fix(webpack): replace serialize-error with a custom implementation r=jhiode a=jhiode

For some reason, serialize-error is unable to successfully detect and resolve a circular error object. The result is an out-of-memory error when the compilation fails. I haven't tested if this is the case for all errors or only some specific ones though.

Another flaw of the previous implementation is that we lose the information whether the error is a compile or build error as the error deserialization always created a plain `Error` instance.
And as an error object only consists of the [three fields `name`,  `message` and  `stack`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/7c6462aa10329884618c51ff9af76c66b503f47c/lib/lib.es5.d.ts#L972-L976
) the serialization of any other fields seems unnecessary to me.

The Xen pciback driver has a list of all pci devices it is ready to
seize. There is no check whether a to be added entry already exists.
While this might be no problem in the common case it might confuse
those which consume the list via sysfs.

Modify the handling of this list by not adding an entry which already
exists. As this will be needed later split out the list handling into
a separate function.

When creating offload server entries, an IPv6 passive connection request
can trigger a reply with a null STID, whereas the driver would expect
the reply 'STID to match the value used for the request.
This happens due to h/w limitation on T4 and T5.

This patch ensures that STID 0 is never used if the stid range starts
from zero.

Currently, calc width is Work-In-Progress, so it wont be supported now, and these ref
tests should automatically take care once Webkit enables it. Need to keep an eye on it.

* fast/forms/fieldset-width-nostretch-ifspecified-expected.html: Added.

Make use of the common autotools module that is used to generate the MSVC
project files from their respective templates so that the main build files
beccome cleaner, and enhance them in a way that the headers that should be
installed can be written to the property sheets during 'make dist', so that
the chances of missing headers for MSVC builds can be greatly reduced.

Also use this autotools module to fill in the projects for
glib-compile-schemas and glib-compile-resources.

Here we go:

Add a fallback udev call to udevsend. If udevsend is unable to send the
event to udevd, we call the udev binary instead of doing nothing and exiting.

google/llvm-propeller,7d057efddc00ba7d03e6e684f23dd9b09fbd0527,[CUDA] Work around a bug in rint/nearbyint caused by a broken implementation provided by CUDA.,"

Normally math functions are forwarded to __nv_* counterparts provided by CUDA's
libdevice bitcode. However, __nv_rint*()/__nv_nearbyint*() functions there have
a bug -- they use round() which rounds *up* instead of rounding towards the
nearest integer, so we end up with rint(2.5f) producing 3.0 instead of expected
2.0. The broken bitcode is not actually used by NVCC itself, which has both a
work-around in CUDA headers and, in recent versions, uses correct
implementations in NVCC's built-ins.

This patch implements equivalent workaround and directs rint*/nearbyint* to
__builtin_* variants that produce correct results.

apache/spark,0818fdec3733ec5c0a9caa48a9c0f2cd25f84d13,[SPARK-8406] [SQL] Adding UUID to output file name to avoid accidental overwriting,"

This PR fixes a Parquet output file name collision bug which may cause data loss.  Changes made:

1.  Identify each write job issued by `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation` with a UUID

    All concrete data sources which extend `HadoopFsRelation` (Parquet and ORC for now) must use this UUID to generate task output file path to avoid name collision.

2.  Make `TestHive` use a local mode `SparkContext` with 32 threads to increase parallelism

    The major reason for this is that, the original parallelism of 2 is too low to reproduce the data loss issue.  Also, higher concurrency may potentially caught more concurrency bugs during testing phase. (It did help us spotted SPARK-8501.)

3. `OrcSourceSuite` was updated to workaround SPARK-8501, which we detected along the way.

NOTE: This PR is made a little bit more complicated than expected because we hit two other bugs on the way and have to work them around. See [SPARK-8501] [1] and [SPARK-8513] [2].

----

Some background and a summary of offline discussion with yhuai about this issue for better understanding:

In 1.4.0, we added `HadoopFsRelation` to abstract partition support of all data sources that are based on Hadoop `FileSystem` interface.  Specifically, this makes partition discovery, partition pruning, and writing dynamic partitions for data sources much easier.

To support appending, the Parquet data source tries to find out the max part number of part-files in the destination directory (i.e., `<id>` in output file name `part-r-<id>.gz.parquet`) at the beginning of the write job.  In 1.3.0, this step happens on driver side before any files are written.  However, in 1.4.0, this is moved to task side.  Unfortunately, for tasks scheduled later, they may see wrong max part number generated of files newly written by other finished tasks within the same job.  This actually causes a race condition.  In most cases, this only causes nonconsecutive part numbers in output file names.  But when the DataFrame contains thousands of RDD partitions, it's likely that two tasks may choose the same part number, then one of them gets overwritten by the other.

Before `HadoopFsRelation`, Spark SQL already supports appending data to Hive tables.  From a user's perspective, these two look similar.  However, they differ a lot internally.  When data are inserted into Hive tables via Spark SQL, `InsertIntoHiveTable` simulates Hive's behaviors:

1.  Write data to a temporary location

2.  Move data in the temporary location to the final destination location using

    -   `Hive.loadTable()` for non-partitioned table
    -   `Hive.loadPartition()` for static partitions
    -   `Hive.loadDynamicPartitions()` for dynamic partitions

The important part is that, `Hive.copyFiles()` is invoked in step 2 to move the data to the destination directory (I found the name is kinda confusing since no ""copying"" occurs here, we are just moving and renaming stuff).  If a file in the source directory and another file in the destination directory happen to have the same name, say `part-r-00001.parquet`, the former is moved to the destination directory and renamed with a `_copy_N` postfix (`part-r-00001_copy_1.parquet`).  That's how Hive handles appending and avoids name collision between different write jobs.

Some alternatives fixes considered for this issue:

1.  Use a similar approach as Hive

    This approach is not preferred in Spark 1.4.0 mainly because file metadata operations in S3 tend to be slow, especially for tables with lots of file and/or partitions.  That's why `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation` just inserts to destination directory directly, and is often used together with `DirectParquetOutputCommitter` to reduce latency when working with S3.  This means, we don't have the chance to do renaming, and must avoid name collision from the very beginning.

2.  Same as 1.3, just move max part number detection back to driver side

    This isn't doable because unlike 1.3, 1.4 also takes dynamic partitioning into account.  When inserting into dynamic partitions, we don't know which partition directories will be touched on driver side before issuing the write job.  Checking all partition directories is simply too expensive for tables with thousands of partitions.

3.  Add extra component to output file names to avoid name collision

    This seems to be the only reasonable solution for now.  To be more specific, we need a JOB level unique identifier to identify all write jobs issued by `InsertIntoHadoopFile`.  Notice that TASK level unique identifiers can NOT be used.  Because in this way a speculative task will write to a different output file from the original task.  If both tasks succeed, duplicate output will be left behind.  Currently, the ORC data source adds `System.currentTimeMillis` to the output file name for uniqueness.  This doesn't work because of exactly the same reason.

    That's why this PR adds a job level random UUID in `BaseWriterContainer` (which is used by `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelation` to issue write jobs).  The drawback is that record order is not preserved any more (output files of a later job may be listed before those of a earlier job).  However, we never promise to preserve record order when writing data, and Hive doesn't promise this either because the `_copy_N` trick breaks the order.

Summary:
Typ.equivalent is currently defined the same as Typ.castable, but
conceptually they are different and castable needs to be
weakened. They are different since for example it is possible to cast
from an i64 to a f64, but those types denote different sets of values
in the semantics, and the bitcast is modeled using a conversion
function.

TimothyGu/libilbc,72e6cb0b3f548900fd3b548b4b6966e3f5ee854f,Fixes dynamic mode pacing issues.,"

This CL fixes a few issues in the (default-disabled) dynamic pacing
mode:
* Slight update to sleep timing to avoid short spin loops
* Removed support for early execution as that lead to time-travel
  contradictions that were difficult to solve.
* Makes sure we schedule a process call when a packet is due to be
  drained even if the queue is empty, so that padding will start at
  the correct time.
* While paused or empty, sleep relative last send time if we send
  padding while silent - otherwise just relative to last process
  time.
* If target send time shifts so far back that packet should have
  been sent prior to the last process, make sure we don't let the
  buffer level remain.
* Update the PacedSender test to _actually_ use dynamic processing
  when the param says so.

When cpuidle governor choose a C-state to enter for idle CPU, but it notice that
there is tasks request to be executed. So the idle CPU will not really enter
the target C-state and go to run task.

In this situation, it will use the residency of previous really entered target
C-states. Obviously, it is not reasonable.

So, this patch fix it by set the target C-state residency to 0.

Let's simplify things and drop the logic that /var/lib/machines is setup
as auto-growing btrfs loopback file /var/lib/machines.raw.

THis was done in order to make quota available for machine management,
but quite frankly never really worked properly, as we couldn't grow the
file system in sync with its use properly. Moreover philosophically it's
problematic overriding the admin's choice of file system like this.

Let's hence drop this, and simplify things. Deleting code is a good
feeling.

Now that regular file systems provide project quota we could probably
add per-machine quota support based on that, hence the btrfs quota
argument is not that interesting anymore (though btrfs quota is a bit
more powerful as it allows recursive quota, i.e. that the machine pool
gets an overall quota in addition to per-machine quota).

codenameone/CodenameOne,517835c9147d9a176e393eda7ecff0bcb21f211c,Main focus of this commit is to add a lightweight mode flag to the Picker class which causes it to prefer lightweight widgets rather than native widgets.  It includes a new set of Spinner3D widgets (which aren't yet publicly exposed) for the lightweight pickers.  These Spinner3D classes are built on top of a new scene graph implementation (in the com.codename1.ui.scene package) which is currently marked deprecated for internal use only.  The scene graph allows us to create advanced 3D widgets.,"

While the Spinner3D classes will ultimately support full perspective (like the native iOS picker), they are currently juse emulating perspective using 2D transforms.  The code is mostly complete for full perspective support, but debugging on iOS has been difficult, so I have left it turned off for now.

In lightweight mode, all of the picker types are supported except the duration pickers.  Those will be implemented soon as well.

There are still things that need to be done to make this a full viable replacement for native pickers.  For example, we need to add the ability to make the various competing input forms cooperate.  E.g. If the picker is opened, and the user starts editing a text field, then the picker should close automatically as the keboard opens.  And vice-versa.

Another rough edge that needs to be smoothed out is the case where the picker covers dialog covers up the field that opened the picker.  It should automaticlaly scroll the forum so that the field is visible, but it doesn't do this yet.

Tablet support is still todo also.

Most of these todo items will be committed in the next few days.

In C4::Auth there is a use C4::VirtualShelves.
Virtualshelves are displayed in all OPAC pages, but not in intranet.
For performance, we should move this into a require only for opac pages.

This patch adds a condition to fetch virtualshelves only if opac and moves the dependancy on C4::VirtualShelves into require calls.

On my desktop, I have those compilation times for C4/Auth.pm :
- Without patch : 0,41 seconds
- With patch : 0,22 seconds

This performance improvement is very usefull for pages that only use a few as dependancy, like errors/404.pl

Test plan :
- Be sure there are some public lists
- Apply patch
- Go to opac (not logged-in)
- Click on ""Lists""
- Check you see the public lists
- Login with a user
- Be sure this user has some private lists

Instead we can send an empty string which docker-py sends on

This change is to ensure that the root node (e.g. 'user', 'system'...etc)

mvpp2_xdp_submit_frame() is a generic function which is called by
mvpp2_xdp_xmit_back() when doing XDP_TX, and by mvpp2_xdp_xmit when
doing AF_XDP or XDP_REDIRECT target.

The buffer allocation has been reworked to be able to map the buffers
as DMA_FROM_DEVICE or DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL depending if native XDP is
in use or not.

stackforge/python-openstacksdk,ff5b6bc0c9cca89d6c66ae311a9deecea6b2c28b,Add a descriptor object for each service proxy,"

The end-goal here is to be able to do version discovery rather than
relying on config and in-code version defaults for what gets attached to
the connection as the service proxy for a service. However, since we're
currently constructing Adapter objects at instantation time we'd have to
authenticate AND do version discovery on every service when we create a
Connection to be able to do that.

That would be bad.

Add a Descriptor class that creates the Proxy object on-demand. That is,
when someone does ""conn.compute"", a Proxy will be created and returned.

To support doing that without a ton of duplicate copy-pasta for each
service, add a metaclass to Connection which reads os-service-types and
does the import lookup / BaseProxy fallback as part of Connection class
creation. One of the upsides to this is that we can add docstrings to
the service descriptor objects - meaning that the docs for Connection
actually list the proxy objects.

While we're in here, fix a NOTE in a connection doc string and add a
reference to BaseProxy in the docs so that it'll show up in the docs
too.

tprrt/linux-stable,e696028acc458aa3d43ad899371a963eb28336d8,net/sched: Reflect HW offload status,"

Currently there is no way of querying whether a filter is
offloaded to HW or not when using ""both"" policy (where none
of skip_sw or skip_hw flags are set by user-space).

Add two new flags, ""in hw"" and ""not in hw"" such that user
space can determine if a filter is actually offloaded to
hw or not. The ""in hw"" UAPI semantics was chosen so it's
similar to the ""skip hw"" flag logic.

If none of these two flags are set, this signals running
over older kernel.

dslutz/qemu,d3fa923044321b2ccc12bbdedd582d2c49d958aa,"aio: make aio_poll(ctx, true) block with no fds","

This patch drops a special case where aio_poll(ctx, true) returns false
instead of blocking if no file descriptors are waiting on I/O.  Now it
is possible to block in aio_poll() to wait for aio_notify().

This change eliminates busy waiting.  bdrv_drain_all() used to rely on
busy waiting to completed throttled I/O requests but this is no longer
required so we can simplify aio_poll().

Note that aio_poll() still returns false when aio_notify() was used.  In
other words, stopping a blocking aio_poll() wait is not considered
making progress.

Adjust test-aio /aio/bh/callback-delete/one which assumed aio_poll(ctx,
true) would immediately return false instead of blocking.

Previously, in order to assert that the promise was not resolved, an
error was thrown when the promise was resolved successfully. At the
same, `.catch()` was used to silence the (expected) promise rejection.
However, the chained `.catch()` handler would also catch (and swallow)
the error thrown on resolving the promise, making the test pass, even if
the promise was not rejected.

This commit fixes it by ensuring that the error thrown on resolving the
promise is not caught by the rejection handler.

CTSRD-CHERI/u-boot,9b56942f7d2f67e620662cfeb4269a9a938d55da,mtd: onenand: Fix unaligned access,"

Fix unaligned access in OneNAND core. The problem is that the ffchars[] array
is an array of ""unsigned char"", but in onenand_write_ops_nolock() can be passed
to the memcpy_16() function. The memcpy_16() function will treat the buffer as
an array of ""unsigned short"", thus triggering unaligned access if the compiler
decided ffchars[] to be not aligned.

I managed to trigger the problem with regular ELDK 5.4 GCC compiler.

By fixing the asserts on the rollback tests, a bug is exposed when
the OVS switch type is used, since, as can be seen in [0], the

Such conflicts are an accident waiting to happen, and this feature conflicts
with the desire to include existing headers into multiple modules and merge the
results. (In an ideal world, it should not be possible to export internal
linkage symbols from a module, but sadly the glibc and libstdc++ headers
provide 'static inline' functions in a few cases.)

tprrt/linux-stable,be1f985ffa49467f604318182616678b3e5184fd,[media] IR/lirc: further ioctl portability fixups,"

>From Joris van Rantwijk <3884381ed19b071fcba1f27322ce8da0937922a1@xs4all.nl>:

	I tested lirc_serial and found that it works fine.
	Except the LIRC ioctls do not work in my 64-bit-kernel/32-bit-user
	setup. I added compat_ioctl entries in the drivers to fix this.

	While doing so, I noticed inconsistencies in the argument type of
	the LIRC ioctls. All ioctls are declared in lirc.h as having argument
	type __u32, however there are a few places where the driver calls
	get_user/put_user with an unsigned long argument.

	The patch below changes lirc_dev and lirc_serial to use __u32 for all
	ioctl arguments, and adds compat_ioctl entries.
	It should probably also be done in the other low-level drivers,
	but I don't have hardware to test those.

I've dropped the .compat_ioctl addition from Joris' original patch,
as I swear the non-compat definition should now work for both 32-bit
and 64-bit userspace. Technically, I think we still need/want a
in getting a reply to you).

Currently once we touch response.body, every operations of FetchEvent.respondWith(), Cache.put() and resposne.clone() will fail.
This cl makes change to support these operations.

After response.body is touched, all data will be enqueued into ReadableStreamImpl.
This cl use Body::ReadableStreamSource::createDrainingStream() to pull back the data from the ReadableStreamImpl.

When any data was already read from the ReadableStreamImpl, the behavior of these operations are not defined in the spec yet.
So we don't support these operations of the partially comsumed response.

rsocket/rsocket-cpp,d3cb5b1e0d5ff3f37e2d0bde2157a93eed91a105,Fix bug in optimizing module loader for coverage collection,"

Summary:
In coverage collection mode a special module loader is prepended to
`sys.meta_path`. In very specific conditions this module loader can end up
returning a loader pointing to a _completely wrong module_. When importing
symbols from the wrong module errors occur.

The conditions to trigger the bug are:

- running in coverage collection mode, enabling the custom loader
- the test binary is a zip (e.g. par_style=fastzip)
- having a module name where the end part matches the name of a builtin Python
  module

When these conditions were met, the special loader would return the builtin
Python module instead of the expected module. E.g. when loading a module like
`myapp.somemod.platform` in a zip style binary.

The custom loader first calls `imp.find_module()` to find the module it wants
to return a wrapped loader for. This fails for modules included in the test
binary, because the builtin `imp` module can not load from zips. This was the
trigger leading to the call to the buggy code.

When the initial call to `imp.find_module()` failed, the custom loader would
try a second call, asking the internal loader to this time try any path on
`sys.path`. For most module names this call would also fail, making the custom
loader return `None`, after which Python tries other loaders on `sys.path`.
However, when the final part of the module that was asked to load matches the
name of a Python builtin module, then the second call to the `imp` module would
succeed, returning a loader for the builtin module. E.g. `platform` when asking
for `myapp.somemod.platform`.

This diff fixes the issue by removing the broken second call to the internal
loader. This will never have worked, we just have not triggered or noticed
triggering the wrong loading before.

fact, it's harmful: In http://codereview.chromium.org/7550002 ,
a dependency on base is added on the host side, which doesn't
build with clang because e.g. -Wno-char-subscript isn't used,

The difference in signature is that swift_keepAlive2 takes just a pointer while
swift_keepAlive also takes a metadata value that is not necessary for our

opendaylight/controller,2cfa8aed573b09cfc6ab6ba9edc02476635b0896,Initial clustering feature,"

Besides the clustering feature changes a couple of other changes
had to be made to the distributed data store and remote rpc modules
to make the solution work with karaf

1. The akka.conf in sal-clustering-config has now been changed so that
it works in a single node cluster out of the box. Specifically the hostnames
have been set to 127.0.0.1 and the member role has been set to member-1

2. The distributed-data-store and the remote-rpcconnector now load akka
configuration from the configuration/initial folder. The positive thing about
this is that even in a multi-node cluster one does not need to pass the location
of akka.conf on the command line. The negative thing about this is that you
cannot change the location from which the akka configuration can be picked up.
Though this should be ok because we specifically pick modules.conf and
module-shards.conf from the configuration/initial folder as well.

3. The Protobuf bundle has now been wrapped and a Dynamic Import has been
added to it so that it can deserialized specific protocol buffer messages

4. The RestConfProvider was not written to shutdown correctly. While this is
not normally an issue it does become an issue when the clustering feature is
loaded for the first time because in that case the RestConfProvider may need
to be shutdown by the config sub-system

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This PR aims to improve the `merge-spark-pr` script in the following two ways.
1. `[WIP]` is useful when we show that a PR is not ready for merge. Apache Spark allows merging `WIP` PRs. However, sometime, we accidentally forgot to clean up the title for the completed PRs. We had better warn once more during merging stage and get a confirmation from the committers.
2. We have two kinds of PR titles in terms of the ending period. This PR aims to remove the trailing `dot` since the shorter is the better in the commit title. Also, the PR titles without the trailing `dot` is dominant in the Apache Spark commit logs.

d4019f0a92ab ""cpufreq: move freq change notifications to cpufreq core""
added code to the cpufreq core to print an error if a cpufreq driver's
.target() function returned an error. This exposed the fact that Tegra's
cpufreq driver returns an error when it is ignoring requests due to the
system being suspended.

Modify Tegra's .target() function not to return an error in this case;
this prevents the error prints. The argument is that since the suspend
hook can't and doesn't inform the cpufreq core when its requests will
be ignored, there's no way for the cpufreq core to squelch them, so it's
not an error for the requests to keep coming. This change make the Tegra
driver consistent with how the Exynos handles the same situation. Note
that s5pv210-cpufreq.c probably suffers from this same issue though.

coq/coq,7d2f7e1665136f5d7a2882f733ae807e1a55dc7c,Extraction: propagate implicit args in inner fixpoint (bug #4243 part 2),"

 In front of ""let rec f x y = ... in f n m"", if n is now an implicit argument,
 then the argument x of the inner fixpoint f is also considered as implicit.
 This optimization is rather ad-hoc, since we only handle MLapp(MLfix()) for
 now, and the implicit argument should be reused verbatim as argument.
 Note that it might happen that x cannot be implicit in f. But in this
 case we would have add an error message about n still occurring somewhere...
 At least this small heuristic was easy to add, and was sufficient to solve
 the part 2 of bug #4243.

facebook/buck,a0e1fa36363d0b8fec965c1f0f24d0a89cc0506c,Avoid getSubgraph calls in in target graph hashing,"

Summary:
  * `buck target --show-target-hash` commands were making a big number
    of calls to `TargetGraph#getSubgraph` to find all the transitive
    dependencies of the specified node. `getSubgraph` however first
    incrementally builds a `MutableDirectedGraph` and then uses it to
    construct a `TargetGraph`, whose constructor is fairly inefficient,
    in particular it checks that the supplied graph is not cyclic.
  * Since we are only interested in getting all the transitive
    dependencies of the root node and don't actually need the subgraph,
    we can avoid the calls to the expensive `TargetGraph` constructor
    and construct the sets we are interested in using graph traversal.
  * This significantly speeds up target graph hashing, especially if we
    are hashing a big number of nodes.

Test Plan:
  * `buck test`.

Make meson_clk_pll_is_better() consider a rate that precisely matches

Prior to commit 8eed1db1adec6a (""clk: meson: pll: update driver for the

meson_clk_pll_is_better()) if the rate from the current iteration
matches the requested rate precisely. After this commit
meson_clk_pll_is_better() is called unconditionally. This requires

Our first version of elasticsearch-http had a TODO to support multiple
base urls. This implements that feature using round-robin DNS.

Most users will supply a DNS name that's mapped to multiple A or AAAA
records. For example, `http://elasticsearch:9200` will use normal host

tprrt/linux-stable,ef8d1d51aa5ebe4b17b5e837d520df1e398b7adb,qla2xxx: setup data needed in ISR before setting up the ISR,"

qla2xxx first calls request_irq() and then does the setup of the queue
entry data needed in the interrupt handlers in when using MSI-X. This
could lead to a NULL pointer dereference when an IRQ fires between the
request_irq() call and the assignment of the qentry data structure to
the rsp->msix field. A possible case for such a race would be in the
kdump case when the HBA's IRQs are still enabled but the driver is
undergoing a new initialisation and thus is not aware of already
activated IRQs in the HBA.

The patch also rewrites the bit definition using shifts to make them
easier to read.

The older non-SoC chips can probably also use the new header file, but
for this patch the scope is limited to soc/amd, since the older non-SoC
chips don't use the SMBUS controller code in soc/amd/common.

hyperspy/hyperspy,fc61cea2c28f1fac7895f61b11e083ee160d876b,ENH: Load multi-stacks from mulit-signal files,"

When trying to load a stack, previously files that contained multiple
signals were not allowed. This change allows that as long as each file
has the same number of signals. If so, one stack will be created for
each such sub-signal in the files.

Example:
Files 1-10 each contain 3 signals: A, B and C. With the new changes,
loading files 1-10 with stack=True, will return 3 signals of 10 signals
each (A from 1-10, B from 1-10, C from 1-10). The signals are grouped
simply by order loaded, but possibly some logic could be added that
checks for names etc.

Practical use case:
Building stacks from EMI files.

The entity->dependency can go away completely once we've called
drm_sched_entity_add_dependency_cb() (if the cb is called before we
get around to tracing).  The tracepoint is more useful if we trace
every dependency instead of just ones that get callbacks installed,
anyway, so just do that.

chromium/chromium,74d7ed318b94e49028ac0cc0f2595635281ec4c2,Fix a dependency on Blink 'core' things from 'platform',"

Some blink/renderer/platform/loader/ code needs to use the mojom enum
class blink.mojom.ControllerServiceWorkerMode defined in
service_worker_object.mojom-blink.h, which is generated by the gn target
blink/public/mojom:mojom_core_blink.
But, there should have no dependency pathes from Blink platform to
blink/public/mojom:mojom_core_blink, actually it should just be
forbidden because 'core' is a higher level than 'platform'.

This CL extracts blink.mojom.ControllerServiceWorkerMode and puts it
into a new mojom file controller_service_worker_mode.mojom, and
includes it in the gn target blink/public/mojom:mojom_platform_blink,
then we can just rely on the dependency path below to get what we want
originally.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This PR fixes an exception during the compilation of generated code of `mapEntry`. This error occurs since the current code uses `key` type to store a `value` when `key` and `value` types are primitive type.

```
     val mid0 = Literal.create(Map(1 -> 1.1, 2 -> 2.2), MapType(IntegerType, DoubleType))
     checkEvaluation(MapEntries(mid0), Seq(r(1, 1.1), r(2, 2.2)))
```

qtproject/qtqa-gerrit,ed69c9882f52ad460d11985d8909f96acf7734fb,Include all fields in toString() for group audit log entries,"

As 'addedOn' is neither returned as part of Key#members nor the parent
key, it isn't included in the toString() representation of
AccountGroup{Member|ById}Aud{it}.Key. Hence, it isn't included in the
toString() representation of AccountGroup{Member|ById}Aud{it} either.

This poses a problem in the context of consistency checks between groups
in ReviewDb and the ones in NoteDb. If audit entries differ because of
the 'addedOn' field, we won't see this inconsistency in the logged
consistency violations. As that is very impractical, we now provide
an explicit toString() representation for Key which covers all fields.

This problem happens because check_and_switch_context() calls dummy_flush_tlb_a15_erratum() without checking if we are really running on a Cortex-A15 or not.

To avoid this issue, only call dummy_flush_tlb_a15_erratum() inside

From what I can tell this was introduced in issue 64293008 at Nov 29th 2013. Clusterfuzz also broke at that time with a similar stack trace. 

An alternatively fix could be to assert that rootStyle is never set to null in the constructors of CSSToLengthConversionData. However that seems to be a more involved fix and I will leave that for the owner of the code.

apache/spark,6f20a92ca30f9c367009c4556939ea4de4284cb9,[SPARK-17845] [SQL] More self-evident window function frame boundary API,"

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
This patch improves the window function frame boundary API to make it more obvious to read and to use. The two high level changes are:

1. Create Window.currentRow, Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.unboundedFollowing to indicate the special values in frame boundaries. These methods map to the special integral values so we are not breaking backward compatibility here. This change makes the frame boundaries more self-evident (instead of Long.MinValue, it becomes Window.unboundedPreceding).

2. In Python, for any value less than or equal to JVM's Long.MinValue, treat it as Window.unboundedPreceding. For any value larger than or equal to JVM's Long.MaxValue, treat it as Window.unboundedFollowing. Before this change, if the user specifies any value that is less than Long.MinValue but not -sys.maxsize (e.g. -sys.maxsize + 1), the number we pass over to the JVM would overflow, resulting in a frame that does not make sense.

Code example required to specify a frame before this patch:
```
Window.rowsBetween(-Long.MinValue, 0)
```

While the above code should still work, the new way is more obvious to read:
```
Window.rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.currentRow)
```

## How was this patch tested?
- Updated DataFrameWindowSuite (for Scala/Java)
- Updated test_window_functions_cumulative_sum (for Python)
- Renamed DataFrameWindowSuite DataFrameWindowFunctionsSuite to better reflect its purpose

The SH4 manual is not fully clear about that, but real hardware do not
check for the PR bit, which allows to select between single or double
precision, for the fabs instruction. This is probably what is meant by
""Same operation is performed regardless of precision.""

Remove the check, and at the same time use a TCG instruction instead of
a helper to clear one bit.

nwjs/chromium.src,4d9bdfafcd1393385860bc9fe947e0c07719c0f4,Allow consumers of MessageLoop to specify the type of MessageLoop they want.,"

This CL introduces a Type enum to MessageLoop, and I also created subclasses of MessageLoop corresponding to the non-default types: MessageLoopForIO and MessageLoopForUI.

I moved all of the platform-specific MessageLoop APIs onto either MessageLoopForIO or MessageLoopForUI.  MessageLoopForIO gets the Watcher API, and MessageLoopForUI gets the Observer and Dispatcher APIs.  Under the hood, both are implemented in terms of MessagePumpWin, but that will change in a future CL.

The Thread class is changed to allow the consumer to specify the Type of MessageLoop they want to have setup on the created thread.

I re-organized message_loop_unittest.cc and timer_unittest.cc so that I could exercise all (or most) of the tests against each type of MessageLoop.

Note:  I know that ""explicit MessageLoop(Type type = TYPE_DEFAULT);"" is in violation to the style-guide's restriction against default arguments.  I'm working on finding a decent solution to that problem.  Please ignore this issue for now.

The corresponding chrome/ changes are coming in a separate CL due to Reitveld data size limitations.

Provide a singular location where the VMX preemption timer bit is

the VMCS bit is up-to-date without having to modify unrelated code
paths.  For example, the preemption timer can be used to force an
immediate VMExit.  Cache the status of the timer to avoid redundant
VMREAD and VMWRITE, e.g. if the timer stays armed across multiple
VMEnters/VMExits.

This commit modifies the error propagating behavior within the
HasChannelEdge struct. Rather than exiting the function early when a
single edge isn’t found, we instead continue to also possibly retrieve
the second directional edge.

With this change, we avoid a potential infinite gossiping loop in the
routing package that would result if we’d seen one edge but not the
other. In this case the timestamps returned for *both* edges would
always be zero, causing the daemon to always accept and rebroadcast the
announcement putting all other connected lnd’s into the same loop.

nwjs/chromium.src,ee554e80dc1d10fecdec50ae7fbb086c7e9d2041,Add ScreenshotTask for feedback reports.,"

This new class adds functionality to take scaled screenshots to use
in feedback reports. Before this CL the functionality only lived
downstream, but it is going to be needed upstream soon, so this
CL moves the functionality to the public code base.

tprrt/linux-stable,56094edd17971372c7fea078ab41315ebf6214d0,sunrpc: GFP_KERNEL should be GFP_NOFS in crypto code,"

Writes may depend on the auth_gss crypto code, so we shouldn't be
allocating with GFP_KERNEL there.

This still leaves some crypto_alloc_* calls which end up doing
GFP_KERNEL allocations in the crypto code.  Those could probably done at
crypto import time.

The empty string is a valid cache name, so the code must distinguish
between not passed (a null string in Blink) and empty. The distinction
doesn't exist in the Chromium side's string16, so plumb it through
IPC and into the back-end as an extra boolean.

ISSUE:
------
The problem occurs in the following circumstances:
1) When two or more parallel connections result in a
   deadlock detected by INNODB.
2) The query that causes the deadlock is a
   ""SELECT ...GROUP BY ....FOR UPDATE"" that uses loose
   index scan.

SOLUTION:
---------
When INNODB returns ""HA_ERR_LOCK_DEADLOCK"" (or any other
error code), this is not handled by the part of range
optimizer that deals with loose index scan. This error
code will now be passed on to the calling function.
