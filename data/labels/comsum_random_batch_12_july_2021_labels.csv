apple/swift,9514ba5a7d9b6f5d9fcc6751852d71a5074a21d0,[irgen] Lower fix_lifetime => swift_keepAlive().,"

I introduced a function swift_keepAlive2() which has a different signature from
swift_keepAlive() until I can verify that the stdlib is using the new
infrastructure.

The difference in signature is that swift_keepAlive2 takes just a pointer while
swift_keepAlive also takes a metadata value that is not necessary for our
purposes anymore.

Summary:
Since the new blur is more efficient ""fastblur"" or ""simpleblur"" is not needed anymore for fullscreen blur.
Even my old low-end laptop from 2009 (with Intel T3300) can easily do fullscreen blur now with the new method without any hitch at all.

opendaylight/controller,2cfa8aed573b09cfc6ab6ba9edc02476635b0896,Initial clustering feature,"

Besides the clustering feature changes a couple of other changes
had to be made to the distributed data store and remote rpc modules
to make the solution work with karaf

1. The akka.conf in sal-clustering-config has now been changed so that
it works in a single node cluster out of the box. Specifically the hostnames
have been set to 127.0.0.1 and the member role has been set to member-1

2. The distributed-data-store and the remote-rpcconnector now load akka
configuration from the configuration/initial folder. The positive thing about
this is that even in a multi-node cluster one does not need to pass the location
of akka.conf on the command line. The negative thing about this is that you
cannot change the location from which the akka configuration can be picked up.
Though this should be ok because we specifically pick modules.conf and
module-shards.conf from the configuration/initial folder as well.

3. The Protobuf bundle has now been wrapped and a Dynamic Import has been
added to it so that it can deserialized specific protocol buffer messages

4. The RestConfProvider was not written to shutdown correctly. While this is
not normally an issue it does become an issue when the clustering feature is
loaded for the first time because in that case the RestConfProvider may need
to be shutdown by the config sub-system

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This PR aims to improve the `merge-spark-pr` script in the following two ways.
1. `[WIP]` is useful when we show that a PR is not ready for merge. Apache Spark allows merging `WIP` PRs. However, sometime, we accidentally forgot to clean up the title for the completed PRs. We had better warn once more during merging stage and get a confirmation from the committers.
2. We have two kinds of PR titles in terms of the ending period. This PR aims to remove the trailing `dot` since the shorter is the better in the commit title. Also, the PR titles without the trailing `dot` is dominant in the Apache Spark commit logs.

tprrt/linux-stable,2239aa3d15056e4be807eaa8d778b247156ce552,cpufreq: tegra: don't error target() when suspended,"

d4019f0a92ab ""cpufreq: move freq change notifications to cpufreq core""
added code to the cpufreq core to print an error if a cpufreq driver's
.target() function returned an error. This exposed the fact that Tegra's
cpufreq driver returns an error when it is ignoring requests due to the
system being suspended.

Modify Tegra's .target() function not to return an error in this case;
this prevents the error prints. The argument is that since the suspend
hook can't and doesn't inform the cpufreq core when its requests will
be ignored, there's no way for the cpufreq core to squelch them, so it's
not an error for the requests to keep coming. This change make the Tegra
driver consistent with how the Exynos handles the same situation. Note
that s5pv210-cpufreq.c probably suffers from this same issue though.

 In front of ""let rec f x y = ... in f n m"", if n is now an implicit argument,
 then the argument x of the inner fixpoint f is also considered as implicit.
 This optimization is rather ad-hoc, since we only handle MLapp(MLfix()) for
 now, and the implicit argument should be reused verbatim as argument.
 Note that it might happen that x cannot be implicit in f. But in this
 case we would have add an error message about n still occurring somewhere...
 At least this small heuristic was easy to add, and was sufficient to solve
 the part 2 of bug #4243.

Summary:
  * `buck target --show-target-hash` commands were making a big number
    of calls to `TargetGraph#getSubgraph` to find all the transitive
    dependencies of the specified node. `getSubgraph` however first
    incrementally builds a `MutableDirectedGraph` and then uses it to
    construct a `TargetGraph`, whose constructor is fairly inefficient,
    in particular it checks that the supplied graph is not cyclic.
  * Since we are only interested in getting all the transitive
    dependencies of the root node and don't actually need the subgraph,
    we can avoid the calls to the expensive `TargetGraph` constructor
    and construct the sets we are interested in using graph traversal.
  * This significantly speeds up target graph hashing, especially if we
    are hashing a big number of nodes.

Test Plan:
  * `buck test`.

Make meson_clk_pll_is_better() consider a rate that precisely matches
the requested rate to be better than any previous rate (which was
smaller than the current).

Prior to commit 8eed1db1adec6a (""clk: meson: pll: update driver for the
g12a"") meson_clk_get_pll_settings() returned early (before calling
meson_clk_pll_is_better()) if the rate from the current iteration
matches the requested rate precisely. After this commit
meson_clk_pll_is_better() is called unconditionally. This requires
meson_clk_pll_is_better() to work with the case where ""now == rate"".

This fixes a hang during boot on Meson8b / Odroid-C1 for me.

Our first version of elasticsearch-http had a TODO to support multiple

Most users will supply a DNS name that's mapped to multiple A or AAAA

lookups to get the list of IP addresses.

You can alternatively supply a list of http base urls. This list is used
to recover from failures. Note that all ports must be the same, and the
scheme must be http, not https.

Here are some examples:

qla2xxx first calls request_irq() and then does the setup of the queue
entry data needed in the interrupt handlers in when using MSI-X. This
could lead to a NULL pointer dereference when an IRQ fires between the
request_irq() call and the assignment of the qentry data structure to
the rsp->msix field. A possible case for such a race would be in the
kdump case when the HBA's IRQs are still enabled but the driver is
undergoing a new initialisation and thus is not aware of already
activated IRQs in the HBA.

When trying to load a stack, previously files that contained multiple
signals were not allowed. This change allows that as long as each file
has the same number of signals. If so, one stack will be created for
each such sub-signal in the files.

Example:
Files 1-10 each contain 3 signals: A, B and C. With the new changes,
loading files 1-10 with stack=True, will return 3 signals of 10 signals
each (A from 1-10, B from 1-10, C from 1-10). The signals are grouped
simply by order loaded, but possibly some logic could be added that
checks for names etc.

Practical use case:

Previously, these constants/reference data were re-generated for
each note in a serialized song, each time a serialized song was
generated. (I.e., a lot of times during normal usage of the app).
However, this data never changes so there's no reason to do so.

Although I don't think this had a practical negative impact, it
seems like an easy thing to avoid.

The entity->dependency can go away completely once we've called
drm_sched_entity_add_dependency_cb() (if the cb is called before we
get around to tracing).  The tracepoint is more useful if we trace
every dependency instead of just ones that get callbacks installed,
anyway, so just do that.

chromium/chromium,74d7ed318b94e49028ac0cc0f2595635281ec4c2,Fix a dependency on Blink 'core' things from 'platform',"

Some blink/renderer/platform/loader/ code needs to use the mojom enum
class blink.mojom.ControllerServiceWorkerMode defined in
service_worker_object.mojom-blink.h, which is generated by the gn target
blink/public/mojom:mojom_core_blink.
But, there should have no dependency pathes from Blink platform to
blink/public/mojom:mojom_core_blink, actually it should just be
forbidden because 'core' is a higher level than 'platform'.

This CL extracts blink.mojom.ControllerServiceWorkerMode and puts it
into a new mojom file controller_service_worker_mode.mojom, and
includes it in the gn target blink/public/mojom:mojom_platform_blink,
then we can just rely on the dependency path below to get what we want
originally.

The test doesn't fail reliably enough for an expected fail tag, as every

The other test was testing for the behaviour we now don't want, so has
been modified to have a weighting change in it to stop the allocation

This patch adds remove station functionality, which is required for

qtproject/qtqa-gerrit,ed69c9882f52ad460d11985d8909f96acf7734fb,Include all fields in toString() for group audit log entries,"

As 'addedOn' is neither returned as part of Key#members nor the parent
key, it isn't included in the toString() representation of
AccountGroup{Member|ById}Aud{it}.Key. Hence, it isn't included in the
toString() representation of AccountGroup{Member|ById}Aud{it} either.

This poses a problem in the context of consistency checks between groups
in ReviewDb and the ones in NoteDb. If audit entries differ because of
the 'addedOn' field, we won't see this inconsistency in the logged
consistency violations. As that is very impractical, we now provide
an explicit toString() representation for Key which covers all fields.

Commit 93dc688 (ARM: 7684/1: errata: Workaround for Cortex-A15 erratum 798181 (TLBI/DSB operations)) causes the following undefined instruction error on a mx53 (Cortex-A8):

Internal error: Oops - undefined instruction: 0 [#1] SMP ARM

PC is at check_and_switch_context+0x17c/0x4d0

This problem happens because check_and_switch_context() calls dummy_flush_tlb_a15_erratum() without checking if we are really running on a Cortex-A15 or not.

To avoid this issue, only call dummy_flush_tlb_a15_erratum() inside
check_and_switch_context() if erratum_a15_798181() returns true, which means that we are really running on a Cortex-A15.

From what I can tell this was introduced in issue 64293008 at Nov 29th 2013. Clusterfuzz also broke at that time with a similar stack trace. 

An alternatively fix could be to assert that rootStyle is never set to null in the constructors of CSSToLengthConversionData. However that seems to be a more involved fix and I will leave that for the owner of the code.

apache/spark,6f20a92ca30f9c367009c4556939ea4de4284cb9,[SPARK-17845] [SQL] More self-evident window function frame boundary API,"

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
This patch improves the window function frame boundary API to make it more obvious to read and to use. The two high level changes are:

1. Create Window.currentRow, Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.unboundedFollowing to indicate the special values in frame boundaries. These methods map to the special integral values so we are not breaking backward compatibility here. This change makes the frame boundaries more self-evident (instead of Long.MinValue, it becomes Window.unboundedPreceding).

2. In Python, for any value less than or equal to JVM's Long.MinValue, treat it as Window.unboundedPreceding. For any value larger than or equal to JVM's Long.MaxValue, treat it as Window.unboundedFollowing. Before this change, if the user specifies any value that is less than Long.MinValue but not -sys.maxsize (e.g. -sys.maxsize + 1), the number we pass over to the JVM would overflow, resulting in a frame that does not make sense.

Code example required to specify a frame before this patch:
```
Window.rowsBetween(-Long.MinValue, 0)
```

While the above code should still work, the new way is more obvious to read:
```
Window.rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.currentRow)
```

## How was this patch tested?
- Updated DataFrameWindowSuite (for Scala/Java)
- Updated test_window_functions_cumulative_sum (for Python)
- Renamed DataFrameWindowSuite DataFrameWindowFunctionsSuite to better reflect its purpose

This could possibly be due to CAPI errors/lag, so only use it as the source
when the values aren't yet set.  Otherwise Journal should always have provided
the correct value in a timely manner.

dslutz/qemu,57f5c1b093e1c3ec185770d2a180259205f980be,target/sh4: do not check for PR bit for fabs instruction,"

The SH4 manual is not fully clear about that, but real hardware do not
check for the PR bit, which allows to select between single or double
precision, for the fabs instruction. This is probably what is meant by
""Same operation is performed regardless of precision.""

Remove the check, and at the same time use a TCG instruction instead of
a helper to clear one bit.

Tested via Proxmox and Vultr (hosted).

Note:  The virtblk block device is dynamically allocated starting at 254 and
decreasing until an unused block device index is found.

With these kernel configs enabled: (devtmpfs)
--
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y
--
The /dev/vd* block devices are automatically created to match the dynamic index,
as is the case for the astlinux image.

For runnix and runnix-iso, we currently don't enable devtmpfs, and no loadable modules,
so everything is built-in to the kernel core.  As such we use device_table_dev.txt to
statically assign virtblk to index 254.

If runnix and runnix-iso ever supported multiple dynamically assigned block devices, it
may be worth looking at enabling devtmpfs.

nwjs/chromium.src,4d9bdfafcd1393385860bc9fe947e0c07719c0f4,Allow consumers of MessageLoop to specify the type of MessageLoop they want.,"

This CL introduces a Type enum to MessageLoop, and I also created subclasses of MessageLoop corresponding to the non-default types: MessageLoopForIO and MessageLoopForUI.

I moved all of the platform-specific MessageLoop APIs onto either MessageLoopForIO or MessageLoopForUI.  MessageLoopForIO gets the Watcher API, and MessageLoopForUI gets the Observer and Dispatcher APIs.  Under the hood, both are implemented in terms of MessagePumpWin, but that will change in a future CL.

The Thread class is changed to allow the consumer to specify the Type of MessageLoop they want to have setup on the created thread.

I re-organized message_loop_unittest.cc and timer_unittest.cc so that I could exercise all (or most) of the tests against each type of MessageLoop.

Note:  I know that ""explicit MessageLoop(Type type = TYPE_DEFAULT);"" is in violation to the style-guide's restriction against default arguments.  I'm working on finding a decent solution to that problem.  Please ignore this issue for now.

The corresponding chrome/ changes are coming in a separate CL due to Reitveld data size limitations.

The libtrust keyfile which is used to set the ""ID"" property of a daemon must be generated or loaded on every startup.
If the process crashes during startup this could cause the file to be incomplete causing future startup errors.
Ensure that the file is written atomically to ensure the file is never in an incomplete state.

LightningNetwork/lnd,630afbdc93279189ef226f9de0beec154015b69d,channeldb: don't return error from HasChannelEdge if single edge doesn't exist,"

This commit modifies the error propagating behavior within the
HasChannelEdge struct. Rather than exiting the function early when a
single edge isn’t found, we instead continue to also possibly retrieve
the second directional edge.

With this change, we avoid a potential infinite gossiping loop in the
routing package that would result if we’d seen one edge but not the
other. In this case the timestamps returned for *both* edges would
always be zero, causing the daemon to always accept and rebroadcast the
announcement putting all other connected lnd’s into the same loop.

downstream, but it is going to be needed upstream soon, so this
CL moves the functionality to the public code base.

Writes may depend on the auth_gss crypto code, so we shouldn't be
allocating with GFP_KERNEL there.

This still leaves some crypto_alloc_* calls which end up doing
GFP_KERNEL allocations in the crypto code.  Those could probably done at
crypto import time.

The empty string is a valid cache name, so the code must distinguish
between not passed (a null string in Blink) and empty. The distinction
doesn't exist in the Chromium side's string16, so plumb it through
IPC and into the back-end as an extra boolean.

ISSUE:
------
The problem occurs in the following circumstances:
1) When two or more parallel connections result in a
   deadlock detected by INNODB.
2) The query that causes the deadlock is a
   ""SELECT ...GROUP BY ....FOR UPDATE"" that uses loose
   index scan.

SOLUTION:
---------
When INNODB returns ""HA_ERR_LOCK_DEADLOCK"" (or any other
error code), this is not handled by the part of range
optimizer that deals with loose index scan. This error
code will now be passed on to the calling function.
