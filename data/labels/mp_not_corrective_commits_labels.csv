We have some annoying xfstests tests that will create a very small fs,
fill it up, delete it, and repeat to make sure everything works right.
This trips btrfs up sometimes because we may commit a transaction to
free space, but most of the free metadata space was being reserved by
the global reserve.  So we commit and update the global reserve, but the
space is simply added to bytes_may_use directly, instead of trying to
add it to existing tickets.  This results in ENOSPC when we really did
have space.  Fix this by calling btrfs_try_granting_tickets once we add
back our excess space to wake any pending tickets.

GNOME/gnome-shell,8f424e7d96c823552f30cde2bd4471fedb42031e,"util: Add createTimeLabel()

On locales that support it, time formats should follow the 12-hour/24-hour
preference, which implies that they should be updated when the setting
changes. So add another utility method which creates a label for a specific
time and keeps it in sync with the format setting.

chromium/chromium,c29a991d2542140a8e8a30e894832172c8042596,"[Power: ML]: Add UMA logging for ML service Smart Dim calls

Add UMA logging of time taken to complete ML service requests,
as well as the time spent before a pending request is cancelled.
Also update the existing Smart Dim unit tests to verify that the logging
works.

Bug: 893425, 914640
Test: - Builds and boots, inference calls checked via logs on nocturne
      - All related unit tests still pass.

Add a format option to the datatables export that remove .noExport
elements present in a data cell, just as .noExport columns are
not exported.

To test:
1. For late orders (which uses .noExport elements in data cells) :
    Export data in any format using the export button at the top
    of the datatable.
        => data should exclude ""Add/Edit note"" label, but
        otherwise look the same as before the patch.
2. Try exporting data in other datatables in Koha and make sure
exported data is the same before and after applying the patch.

sosreport/sos,aee752eb016e70ed165c05224d5722b0db07dfb5,"[Plugin] Apply cmd predicates to add_cmd_output

If no predicate was passed to add_cmd_output() calls, then a predicate
set by set_cmd_predicate() was not being applied to those calls, thus
leading to a 'None' predicate being evaluated and potentially causing an
exception in plugins such as docker where the bulk of command collection
is gated by the service running.

Now if no predicate is handed to add_cmd_output(), and a cmd_predicate
has been set, then the cmd_predicate is applied before being handed off
to the _add_cmd_output() helper.

Once we've copied some data for an iocb that is marked with IOCB_WAITQ,
we should no longer attempt to async lock a new page. Instead make sure
we return the copied amount, and let the caller retry, instead of
returning -EIOCBQUEUED for a new page.

This should only be possible with read-ahead disabled on the below
device, and multiple threads racing on the same file. Haven't been able
to reproduce on anything else.

Automatic merge from submit-queue.

print INFO log for Istio CA

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Since Istio CA codebase does not use V-logging yet, all `glog.Info` messages are silently swallowed by glog because by default, only debug or above level logs are printed. This makes it very difficult to debug CA issues. So I changed the default log threshold to INFO.

damianavila/RISE,a381a9754d4b9c70fa04c93d182565770847530f,"A first reasonably complete implementation for #309

I have rewritten the way configurations get loaded, so as to avoid the need for promises in the core of the code

In particular it is possible to use the 'rise' key in a notebook metadata in addition to the legacy 'livereveal'  one; 'rise' takes precedence when applicable.

One thing that I have not been able to tackle at all is how to package the new files so that everything works smoothly after installation through pip or conda.

The file configurator.md, as well as rise.png, are accessories that show up in the configurator page, they are just placeholders for now and need to be more elaborate

A few fixes were made to the example slides in the mix, in particular to reflect the use of 'rise' rather than 'livereveal' in the metadata. This probably requires quite a few further changes in the documentation.

1a1c23f8d40116741f0e26cdf22688fd91c923fc [net processing] Change cs_main TRY_LOCK to LOCK in SendMessages() (John Newbery)

Pull request description:

  The motivation for this PR is to reduce the scope of cs_main locking in misbehavior logic. It is the first set of commits from a larger branch to move the misbehavior data out of CNodeState and into a new struct that doesn't take cs_main.

  There are some very minor behavior changes in this branch, such as:

  - Not checking for discouragement/disconnect in `ProcessMessages()` (and instead relying on the following check in `SendMessages()`)
  - Checking for discouragement/disconnect as the first action in `SendMessages()` (and not doing ping message sending first)
  - Continuing through `SendMessages()` if `MaybeDiscourageAndDisconnect()` doesn't disconnect the peer (rather than dropping out of `SendMessages()`

Generic rules like:

  %: %.in

have the downside that the source (%.in) itself matches the target
(via %.in: %.in.in). This leads to things like:

  Looking for a rule with intermediate file `doc/examples/hooks/ipsec.in.in'.
   Trying pattern rule with stem `ipsec.in.in'.
   Trying implicit prerequisite `doc/examples/hooks/ipsec.in.in.in'.

   Looking for a rule with intermediate file `doc/examples/hooks/ipsec.in.in.in'.
  Rejecting impossible implicit prerequisite `doc/examples/hooks/ipsec.in.in'.

To fix this, we need to tell make that such rules are terminating, so
that it doesn't recurse into them.

Why: GenerateComponentAction should only be available when the spec is present. Therefore we can remove a bit of error checking logic. This makes the code easier to read.

Right now we have allocation code in pci-ioda.c and traversing code in
pci.c, let's keep them toghether. However both files are big enough
already so let's move this business to a new file.

While we at it, move the code which links IOMMU table groups to
IOMMU tables as it is not specific to any PNV PHB model.

These puts exported symbols from the new file together.

This fixes several warnings from checkpatch.pl like this:
""WARNING: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'"".

As this is almost cut-n-paste, there should be no behavioral change.

Currently key_size of hashtab is limited to MAX_BPF_STACK.
As the key of hashtab can also be a value from a per cpu map it can be
larger than MAX_BPF_STACK.

The use-case for this patch originates to implement allow/disallow
lists for files and file paths. The maximum length of file paths is
defined by PATH_MAX with 4096 chars including nul.
This limit exceeds MAX_BPF_STACK.

From: Dan Williams <24ee2bf0bd8ac766c348bf1f0639943bac1535c6@intel.com>

Commit a4456856 refactored some of the deep code paths in raid5.c into separate
functions.  The names chosen at the time do not consistently indicate what is
going to happen to the stripe.  So, update the names, and since a stripe is a
cache element use cache semantics like fill, dirty, and clean.

Basically, The formatter now use the VarDumper & use more significant colors and has a more compact / readable format (IMHO).

servo/webrender,81d03c6ba24b30a61459b051f60204cdecffdd4e,"Bug 1614655 - Part 2: Allow 1:n mapping of Gecko - WR display items r=jrmuizel

This patch changes the underlying storage for WR display items in DisplayItemCache
from Vec<Option<CachedDisplayItem> to Vec<Vec<CachedDisplayItem>>.
This allows storing multiple WebRender display items for one Gecko display item.

The storage is populated by traversing BuiltDisplayList extra data portion
in display list format, which is roughly as follows:
RetainedItems(key k1)
Item1(..)
RetainedItems(key k2)
ItemN(..)
ItemN+1(..)

This would store Item1 under key k1, and ItemN and ItemN+1 under the key k2,
where k1 and k2 are arbitrary unique identifiers (currently of type uint16_t).

The entries in the storage are accessed by DisplayItemCache::get_iterator(key),
which is called by BuiltDisplayListIter, whenever it encounters a display item
DisplayItem::ReuseItems(key).

So far we only had an instruction flag which made an arbitrary number
of operands optional.  This limits error checking capabilities for
instructions marked that way.  With this patch the optparm flag only
allows a single optional parameter and another one is added (optparm2)
allowing 2 optional arguments.  Hopefully we won't need more than that
in the future. So far there will be only a single use of optparm2.

When building with W=1, GCC complains that we haven't defined prototypes
for a number of non-static functions in entry-common.c:

| arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:203:25: warning: no previous prototype for 'el1_sync_handler' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
|   203 | asmlinkage void noinstr el1_sync_handler(struct pt_regs *regs)
|       |                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:377:25: warning: no previous prototype for 'el0_sync_handler' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
|   377 | asmlinkage void noinstr el0_sync_handler(struct pt_regs *regs)
|       |                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| arch/arm64/kernel/entry-common.c:447:25: warning: no previous prototype for 'el0_sync_compat_handler' [-Wmissing-prototypes]

|       |                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

... and so automated build systems using W=1 end up sending a number of
emails, despite this not being a real problem as the only callers are in
entry.S where prototypes cannot matter.

For similar cases in entry-common.c we added prototypes to
asm/exception.h, so let's do the same thing here for consistency.

Note that there are a number of other warnings printed with W=1, both
under arch/arm64 and in core code, and this patch only addresses the
cases in entry-common.c. Automated build systems typically filter these
warnings such that they're only reported when changes are made nearby,
so we don't need to solve them all at once.

chromium/chromium,ceebf65973cecc835a4c4b160c08cc1c00bb2fc4,"Test synchronization between WA API and compositor.

Previously, we had a regression where changes to the state of an
animation were not always picked up by the compositor. Some WPT
tests were written to verify that the compositor picks up the changes;
however, these tests are prone to flaking due to the need  to take a
screenshot while the animation is running to verify the behavior. This
patch does not address the flakiness of the ref tests, but ensures
proper unit test coverage in the event that the ref tests get disabled.
Followup patches will address flakiness in the WPT tests.

These changes are all in accordance with Marko's wishes, except for

Discussing this earlier with Marko on IM, turn-key CSS styles with

This change introduces the storage cell which looks very similar to
IStorageEngine. There are two differences:
  1. A storage cell can be listed as ""fixed key space"" which means
     that it does not support new keys. This will be true when we
     mount our old indexed db stores.
  2. All commands are designed to be batched commands. This is to
     create consistency with what each command expects as input and
     returns. This should allow each implementation of storage cells
     to better optimize their operations.

WebView must save save seeds separately. Serialize with protos, and add

truncation unambiguous. The proto wire format is such that truncation in the

While answering a stackoverflow question on how to create an item but only
if we don't already have an item with the same key, I realized that we never
actually tested that ConditionExpressions works on key columns: all the
tests we had in test_condition_expression.py had conditions on non-key
attributes. So in this patch we add two tests with a condition on the key
attribute.

Most examples of conditions on the key attributes would be silly, but
in these two tests we demonstrate how a test on key attributes can be
useful to solve the above need of creating an item if no such item
exists yet. We demonstrate two ways to do this using a condition on
the key - using either the ""<>"" (not equal) operator, or the
""attribute_not_exists()"" function.

These tests pass - we don't have a bug in this. But it's nice to have
a test that confirms that we don't (and don't regress in that area).

* Basic macro support.

This adds basic macro support as discussed in #695.

It does not completely implement the spec outlined there, specifically:

- The macro can only specify the title using a function in `macroFn.title`. We discussed allowing `macroFn.title` to also be a string, and allowing some form of template language for extracting a title. However, using ES2015 string templates is already pretty easy, so we may just skip this.
- We discussed allowing groups of tests to be created using arrays.

Both the above proposals are found in [this comment](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/issues/695#issuecomment-205929738). They both enhance the implementation found in this commit, and would not break the contract. So I don't think there is anything preventing us from shipping this now.

* fix readme indentation

* spread arguments

* Allow arrays of macros

* pass providedTitle as first argument to title function.

apache/spark,744c2480b580e0b68387328926ef7634cfb93adc,"[SPARK-31443][SQL] Fix perf regression of toJavaDate

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?
Optimise the `toJavaDate()` method of `DateTimeUtils` by:
1. Re-using `rebaseGregorianToJulianDays` optimised by #28067
2. Creating `java.sql.Date` instances from milliseconds in UTC since the epoch instead of date-time fields. This allows to avoid ""normalization"" inside of  `java.sql.Date`.

Also new benchmark for collecting dates is added to `DateTimeBenchmark`.

### Why are the changes needed?
The changes fix the performance regression of collecting `DATE` values comparing to Spark 2.4 (see `DateTimeBenchmark` in https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark/pull/27):

Spark 2.4.6-SNAPSHOT:

### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?
No

### How was this patch tested?
- By existing tests suites, in particular, `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `RebaseDateTimeSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite`.
- Re-run `DateTimeBenchmark` in the environment:

tprrt/linux-stable,6cedba8962f440c72447f811d0d530a8a9dc637a,"vfs: take i_mutex on renamed file

A read delegation is used by NFSv4 as a guarantee that a client can
perform local read opens without informing the server.

The open operation takes the last component of the pathname as an
argument, thus is also a lookup operation, and giving the client the
above guarantee means informing the client before we allow anything that
would change the set of names pointing to the inode.

Therefore, we need to break delegations on rename, link, and unlink.

We also need to prevent new delegations from being acquired while one of
these operations is in progress.

We could add some completely new locking for that purpose, but it's
simpler to use the i_mutex, since that's already taken by all the
operations we care about.

The single exception is rename.  So, modify rename to take the i_mutex
on the file that is being renamed.

Also fix up lockdep and Documentation/filesystems/directory-locking to
reflect the change.

Until now, calls to ugettext were used, which looked over all the files in a project. This is not ideal for big projects specially. The new implementation looks for the translation in the same file as the original text comes from and the matching is done using the getid() method of the unit.

This is O(n) though, and for future improvements we should think about using an index (makeindex() in translate::storage::base).

Apart from that, this commit also adds support for plural forms, which wasn't present yet.

This fixes bug 605.

colinsc/koha,4bc46dbbcb93ca43b2fd138cf65f51893978b3ad,"Bug 12046: Authentication using CAS - bootstrap

At the OPAC, if the bootstrap theme is used, the modal
dialog does not allow to use the CAS authentication.

This patch proposes, in case CAS is enabled, to
redirect to the opac-user.pl page (like prog theme).
This is because the popup content should stay small
(thinking about mobile surf), and that CAS url is
actually only computed in opac-user (see C4/Auth.pm)
and it would not be performant to compute it in all
pages.

Test plan:
- set syspref opacthemes to bootstrap
- enable the casAuthentication syspref
- fill the casServerUrl syspref with something like:
  https://localhost:8443/cas
- go on the opac home page
- click on ""Log in to your account"" link (top right)
=> You go to cgi-bin/koha/opac-user.pl page where you
  see the cas link
- disable the casAuthentication syspref
- go on the opac home page
- click on ""Log in to your account"" link (top right)
=> You see a popup for login and password

Instead of printing a warning and getting the user to configure
logging, do a very basicConfig-like configuration at the module
level. This logs warnings and above to sys.stderr using the basic
format (not unlike a plain old print statement), thereby ensuring
that the user receives these warnings and errors.

While this behaviour is strongly discouraged by the logging
documentation, the saving grace is that the configured handler
also has a filter that disables the handler once the user properly
configures logging at the application or script level.

For integrated TV there are 3 connector types: S-VIDEO, Composite and
Component(YprPb). Those tv formats whose component flag is true should
be assigned to Component connector, others are for S-VIDEO and Composite.
The patch intends to find appropriate tv format for each connector.
In such case it will return the correct modeline to user space. Otherwise
it will return the incorrect modeline when S-video/composite is connected.

Summary: We already call `parseMetadata()` on the `EncodedImage` in various producers (which tries to set the image format) so in theory the image format should never be null in the first place. However, if we have an error and we manage to determine the image type later in the decoding step, we might as well update the encoded images so that subsequent decoding steps are faster.

`gn format` recently changed its formatting behavior
for deps, source, and a few other elements when they
are assigned (with =) single-element lists to be consistent
with the formatting of updates (with +=) with single-element.

Now that we've rolled in a GN binary with the change,
reformat all files so that people don't get presubmit
warnings due to this.

chromium/chromium,95172de18f7e8e820872db6096142a7dccb6c6c7,"[ios] Replace SnapshotCacheFactory with SnapshotBrowserAgent

Create SnapshotBrowserAgent, whose lifetime is tied to the Browser.
Remove SnapshotCacheFactory, whose lifetime is tied to the BrowserState
(profile). This allows separate windows to have their own folder so that
session data can be purged.

To achieve this:
1) Add a uniqueIdentifier to the SnapshotCache, which is used in the
filepath where snapshots are stored on disk.
2) Set the UISceneSession's persistentIdentifier as the SnapshotCache's
uniqueIdentifier.
3) Plumb the SnapshotCache associated with a Browser to all the
SnapshotTabHelpers and SnapshotGenerators that are associated with
WebStates in the WebStateList in the Browser.
4) Replace all uses of SnapshotCacheFactory with SnapshotBrowserAgent.

We have a pretty short hiring process. The first phone screening is done by the Head of Engineering and usually takes 30 minutes. If the candidate seems to fit well, he is invited for a personal interview. In this interview, the candidate is asked to present one of his previous works. If the candidate does not have a project that he can or would like to present, we ask him to complete a take-home task. For junior developers, this consists of the implementation of a small project. For senior developers the task consists of the analysis of a small project with various problems. If everything works out the candidate get's an offer right after this interview.

nfc-tools/libnfc,8f8f780c2bdd95b8609b43d37f9f4982825851d4,"drivers: pn532_i2c: Respect proper timing specifications

The pn532 user manual states that after a i2c stop condition and before a i2c
start condition there should be a delay of minimally 1.3 milliseconds.
This is probably a limitation of the i2c peripheral or the firmware. In
any case, each i2c_read and i2c_write creates the packets which are
complemented with start/stop markers. It is thus required to take care
of timing in these two functions.

We solve this by wrapping the lower i2c_read and i2c_write functions for
the pn532, as this requirement is not for all chips.

Currently, we keep time using local variable, and thus the code is not
thread-safe. With libnfc being single threaded and only one instances of
libnfc can open a bus anyway, this is not yet a problem.

Alternate fix for this issue which avoids putting extra function calls
and exception handling in the fast path.

For almost all purposes, integer timestamps are preferable to
Mercurial. It stores integer timestamps in the dirstate and would thus
like to avoid doing any float/int comparisons or conversions. We will
continue to have to deal with 1-second granularity on filesystems for
quite some time, so this won't significantly hinder our capabilities.

This has some impact on our file cache validation code in that it
lowers timestamp resolution. But as we still have to deal with
low-resolution filesystems, we're not relying on this anyway.

An alternate approach is to use stat[ST_MTIME], which is guaranteed to
be an integer. But since this support isn't already in our extension,
we can't depend on it being available without adding a hard Python->C
API dependency that's painful for people like yours truly who have
bisect regularly and people without compilers.

When the operator chosen to map fixel data to a voxel grid results in a single scalar value per voxel, the output image should logically be a 3D image. However, due to use of the fixel format index image as the template, many such images come out as 4D. This change explicitly sets the output image dimensionality for each choice of operator.

This cl adds an initial support for Ozone (Linux) builds by
utilizing DekstopWindowTreeHostPlatform design.

Actually, it looks very similar to DesktopWindowTreeHostX11 with
a difference that this design in this CL uses Ozone abstraction
layer to communicate with Wayland and other backends.

In overall, BrowserDesktopWindowTreeHostPlatform, which is actually
DesktopWindowTreeHostPlatform, is created and initialized, which triggers
creation of a PlatformWindow, which can be either Wayland, or X11, or other
ozone platform.

Also, DesktopScreenOzone class is added. This object inherits ScreenBase and
is meant to fetch displays data from underlaying ozone backends and provide
aura with necessary data.

Currently, the interaction between Android's ""Chrome sync"" setting

fragile.
I'm hoping to simplify this by making the two settings completely
orthogonal. As a first step, this CL improves the test coverage, and

While we're here, also remove a FlakyTest annotation, since the test

Thanks to rigorous testing in wireless community mesh networks several
issues with multicast entries in the translation table were found and
fixed in the last 1.5 years. Now we see the first larger networks
(a few hundred nodes) with a batman-adv version with multicast
optimizations enabled arising, with no TT / multicast optimization
related issues so far.

Therefore it seems safe to enable multicast optimizations by default.

r5092
2019-10-15

Note: the price column is added in the 'Goods' tab for
each settlement. Will fine-tune it in the next few commits.

## DISCUSSION
1. https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/issues/179

## NEW
1. Add DOLLAR_PER_UNIT, a list of data members,
   computeBaseCost() and computeInputBaseCost() in Good.
2. Add getPricePerItem() in GoodsManager.

## CHANGE
1. Modify number and whitespace alignment when displaying
   a coordinate in string format.
   - Display in 2 decimal places (instead of 1)
   - Add getCoordinateString()
   - Use String.format() to handle extra space before the
     degree in getFormattedLatitudeString() and
getFormattedLongitudeString() in Coordinates.
2. Reduce the height of the table in NavpointPanel to allow
   space for the surface map on the top.
3. Add the price column in the 'Goods' tab in monitor tool.
   - Modify getValueAt() and getColumnName() in
     TradeTableModel
4. Bump down the tech and skill level for all steel, copper
   Aluminum manufacturing class.

## FIX
1. Remove 'barrel' from malfuncions.xml.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

`HiveExternalCatalog` is a semi-public interface. When creating tables, `HiveExternalCatalog` converts the table metadata to hive table format and save into hive metastore. It's very import to guarantee backward compatibility here, i.e., tables created by previous Spark versions should still be readable in newer Spark versions.

Previously we find backward compatibility issues manually, which is really easy to miss bugs. This PR introduces a test framework to automatically test `HiveExternalCatalog` backward compatibility, by downloading Spark binaries with different versions, and create tables with these Spark versions, and read these tables with current Spark version.

Many SMS messaging services reject numbers that do not conform to the E.164 international public telecommunication

We already tell patrons on the OPAC ""Please enter numbers only. (123) 456-7890 would be entered as 1234567890.""

self-service for updating the SMS number.

1) Apply this patch
2) Enable SMS message ( you can set to Email to enable )
3) Test entering and updating SMS numbers on the OPAC and staff
   interfaces.
4) Note you can only enter a 1 to 14 digit number with an optional + sign

tprrt/linux-stable,db7cd91a4be15e1485d6b58c6afc8761c59c4efb,"net: ipv6: fix kconfig dependency warning for IPV6_SEG6_HMAC

When IPV6_SEG6_HMAC is enabled and CRYPTO is disabled, it results in the
following Kbuild warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for CRYPTO_HMAC
  Depends on [n]: CRYPTO [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - IPV6_SEG6_HMAC [=y] && NET [=y] && INET [=y] && IPV6 [=y]

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for CRYPTO_SHA1
  Depends on [n]: CRYPTO [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - IPV6_SEG6_HMAC [=y] && NET [=y] && INET [=y] && IPV6 [=y]

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for CRYPTO_SHA256
  Depends on [n]: CRYPTO [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - IPV6_SEG6_HMAC [=y] && NET [=y] && INET [=y] && IPV6 [=y]

The reason is that IPV6_SEG6_HMAC selects CRYPTO_HMAC, CRYPTO_SHA1, and
CRYPTO_SHA256 without depending on or selecting CRYPTO while those configs
are subordinate to CRYPTO.

Honor the kconfig menu hierarchy to remove kconfig dependency warnings.

JPEG codecs on Exynos4 and Exynos3250 SoCs utilize different number
of planes for storing the raw image data, depending on the format
of the image being processed. For the unused planes a random data
was being written to the related registers. Regardless of the fact
that this seemed not to be harmful, fix the issue for clarity reasons.

There are 3 classes that represent an inline comment:
- CommentInfo represents an inline comment in the REST API
- PatchLineComment represents an inline comment in ReviewDb
- RevisionNote.Comment represents an inline comment in NoteDb

To support robot comments CommentInfo and RevisionNote.Comment must be
extended so that the additional fields that are specific for robot
comments can be supported. PatchLineComment should not be touched
since robot comments will only be supported with NoteDb, but not with
ReviewDb.

At the moment PatchLineComment is also used to represent inline
comments in all middle layers and in all utility classes that deal
with inline comments. This means if NoteDb is used, inline comments
come in over REST as CommentInfo, then they are converted into
PatchLineComment and for storing them in NoteDb they are converted to
RevisionNote.Comment. The intermediate transformation to
PatchLineComment is bad for implementing robot comments, since this
class should stay unchanged.

To fix this RevisionNote.Comment is extracted into an own Comment
class and then Comment is used instead of PatchLineComment in the
middle layer. This means when NoteDb is used, inline comments are only
converted once, from CommentInfo to Comment. Both types will have
extensions for robot comments (by subtypes).

For storing inline comments in ReviewDb inline comments are converted
from CommentInfo to Comment to PatchLineComment. This is better than
having the double-conversion for NoteDb, because ReviewDb will be
removed in favour of NoteDb. This means when ReviewDb is removed
PatchLineComment can then easily be deleted, as it's no longer used
all over the codebase, but only in the ReviewDb layer.

GNOME/glib,32cc60dbffedc537ee2d37b9de695693e7795aae,"gmessages: Fix -Wformat warnings for g_message() and friends

When compiling with G_LOG_USE_STRUCTURED, g_message(), g_debug(), etc.
use g_log_structured(). The message format string and its format
arguments are passed as the final set of arguments in a longer varargs
list, which includes the log domain and level (and other) fields.
Passing the message format in this way means it’s not possible for the
compiler to know to check its format placeholders when compiling with
-Wformat.

Fix support for this by adding a new semi-private helper function,
_g_log_structured_standard(), which only uses varargs for the message
format and its arguments, and uses fixed arguments for the other fields.
This is then converted to a set of GLogFields and passed to
g_log_structured() as normal.

Support for -Wformat when compiling *without* G_LOG_USE_STRUCTURED was
never broken.

Thanks to Tõnis Tartes for part of this solution.

When force format was selected in the options, trying to view the
wiki would redirect to the front page with a message saying that
you do not have permission to edit this page. Students had no way
of viewing any entries or creating the first page.

When in force format it skips a page , which would be considered
uncessary for students, but this means that the group id is not set
and this is what is causing most of the problems.

I also have included a check to see if the title is default and whether
the user has permission to view all groups. In these situations the
intermediate page is displayed.

The current handling of EPOW_SHUTDOWN_ON_UPS event does not shutdown the
system after logging the message. All the events of EPOW_SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN
action code (EPOW_SHUTDOWN_ON_UPS is a part of it) must initiate system
shutdown as per the SPAPR spec. If the LPAR does not shutdown after
receiving this rtas based event, it will expose itself to a forced
abrupt shutdown initiated by the platform firmware. This patch fixes the
situation.

colinsc/koha,efd4121941fb129adc57bca35483cd3334884820,"Bug 23464: Update the process of quick spine label printing

This patch makes changes to the way quick spine label printing works,
either from the bibliographic details page or the Quick spine label
creator page.

To test, apply the patch and go to Tools -> Quick spine label creator.

 - Type or scan a barcode. Submitting the form should trigger a popup
   window with the spine label print page. The ""print"" button should
   be centered at the bottom of the window in a footer-like container.
   - If you have SpineLabelAutoPrint enabled, the print dialog should
     appear automatically.
   - After printing, the pop-up window should close and and focus should
     be returned to the barcode field.

Enable the SpineLabelShowPrintOnBibDetails system preference. View the
bibliographic details page for a record in the catalog.

 - In the holdings table, a ""Spine label"" column should appear as the
   second-to-last column. The column should contain ""Print label""
   Bootstrap-style buttons.
 - Clicking a ""Print label"" button should trigger a pop-up window with
   the spine label print page. The behavior of the window should be the
   same as above.
