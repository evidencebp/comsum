Move the calculation of the Real Mode Area (RMA) size into a helper
function.  While we're there clean it up and correct it in a few ways:
  * Add comments making it clearer where the various constraints come from
  * Remove a pointless check that the RMA fits within Node 0 (we've just
    clamped it so that it does)

----

Import of the XTC experimental package (the implementation of a new
XTC component framework for my thesis).

Features
--------

* New component repository structure 
  - Supports remote repositories (XTService)
* Extensive use of component meta-information 
  - Specification in XTD (Transformation Tool Definition) files 
* Transparent component dispatch 
  - Supports alternative component models
  - Uses configuration templates (for argument substitutions)
* Contract support
* Configuration specialisation (inheritance)

Notes
-----

* Adding XTC3 package 
  - Configure with '--enable-xtc3' to use this XTC library 
  - Added extra configure flag '--with-curl' (location of curl); used
    by the XTC dispatcher
  - Sources of the /strc subpackage are bootstrapped against the XTC
    library in /xtc. building Stratego/XT - with XTC3 enabled - thus 
    requires a clean install (using separate compilation in /strc
    should solve this)
* Library API is compatible with existing XTC library in /xtc
* Compatibility issues: 
  - Arguments passed to 'xtc-transform' and equivalent strategies used
    to be a list of strings. the new XTC framework requires explicit 
    coupling of key/value pair arguments (by putting them in a tuple).    
  - The extensively used 'pass-verbose' strategy  does not adhere to 
    this requirement and can not be overloaded by XTC3 because of
    separate compilation issues. Solution: dispatch checks for
    argument-list elements produced by 'pass-verbose' and merges them.
  - The XTD (transformation tool definition) extension of the xtc tool 
    isn't used yet, requires adjustments to Makefiles. Thus, all tools 
    in Stratego/XT are registered with default meta-information values.
  - The library supports loading of legacy repository files. When these 
    files are altered (for example registration of extra components or
    references) by the XTC3 library, their structure changes. These
    files are then no longer compatible with the existing XTC library 
    in /xtc!
* The dispatcher supports local execution, XT model, http dispatch 
  and the new xtservice model (remote repository and service provider)
  - XTService sources are available in the recently updated stratego-net 
    package

Never fallback to UIL for handling image downloads, only use for displaying.

@relan picked up a bug I introduced while refactoring the icon downloading code in !139. This fixes that bug.

Our `IconDownloader` extended `BaseImageDownloader` from UIL. There was an
explicit check in the F-Droid `IconDownloader` which looks for
HTTP/HTTPS/Bluetooth schemes. If it wasn't one of these, it fell back
to the base class. This was what was happening for local cached image
files. As such, when the `getInputStream(...)` method was refactored
to only use F-Droids `DownloadFactory` and not delegate to the base class,
it failed on local ""file://"" URLs.

This change introduces a `LocalFileDownloader` and makes the `DownloaderFactory`
aware of it.

The `BaseImageDownloader` class only provides support for the following schemes:

 * HTTP
 * HTTPS
 * File
 * Android content providers
 * Android assets
 * Android drawables

F-Droid now supports HTTP, HTTPS, and File URLs. There is not currently any
need for content proiders, assets or drawables to get icons for apps in F-Droid.
If there is a need in the future (e.g. an issue currently discusses loading
icons from installed apps if possible) then that specific `Downloader` can get
introduced to solve the problem.

vinriviere/m68k-atari-mint-binutils-gdb,3d63690a0316d92cf248542ee12a3fc8b30152ea,"gdb/testsuite: Add gdb_test_name variable

This commit adds a new feature to gdb_test_multiple, an automatically
created variable gdb_test_name.  The idea is to make it easier to
write tests using gdb_test_multiple, and avoid places where the string
passed to pass/fail within an action element is different to the
message passed to the top level gdb_test_multiple.

As an example, previously you might write this:

    gdb_test_multiple ""print foo"" ""test foo"" {
       -re ""expected output 1"" {
           pass ""test foo""
       }
       -re ""expected output 2"" {
           fail ""test foo""
       }
    }

This is OK, but it's easy for the pass/fail strings to come out of
sync, or contain a typo.  A better version would look like this:

    set testname ""test foo""
    gdb_test_multiple ""print foo"" $testname {
       -re ""expected output 1"" {
           pass $testname
       }
       -re ""expected output 2"" {
           fail $testname
       }
    }

This is better, but its a bit of a drag having to create a new
variable each time.

After this patch you can now write this:

    gdb_test_multiple ""print foo"" ""test foo"" {
       -re ""expected output 1"" {
           pass $gdb_test_name
       }
       -re ""expected output 2"" {
           fail $gdb_test_name
       }
    }

The $gdb_test_name is setup by gdb_test_multiple, and cleaned up once
the test has completed.  Nested calls to gdb_test_multiple are
supported, though $gdb_test_name will only ever contain the inner most
test message (which is probably what you want).

My only regret is that '$gdb_test_name' is so long, but I wanted
something that was unlikely to clash with any existing variable name,
or anything that a user is likely to want to use.

I've tested this on x86-64/GNU Linux and see no test regressions, and
I've converted one test script over to make use of this new technique
both as an example, and to ensure that the new facility doesn't get
broken.  I have no plans to convert all tests over to this technique,
but I hope others will find this useful for writing tests in the
future.

gdb/testsuite/ChangeLog:

	* lib/gdb.exp (gdb_test_multiple): Add gdb_test_name mechanism.
	* gdb.base/annota1.exp: Update to use gdb_test_name.

The UMA dashboard shows a small amount of non-typical samples for this

SimpleCache histograms are prefixed now (except "".DiskOpenLatency""), and the

recovery and who's shutdown or startup time is quite variable
(so Timeout settings aren't of use).

Here we take these two factors and refuse to start a service if
there are existing processes within a control group. Databases,
while generally having some protection against multiple instances
running, lets not stress the rigor of these. Also ExecStartPre
parts of the service aren't as rigoriously written to protect
against against multiple use.

OSX's DNS service's handling of localhost names changed, I think with 10.12, in a way that combined with JDK releases after a particular point release of 1.8 causes looking up localhost's name to take on the order of seconds for some folks. https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8170910

This patch changes the localhost lookup so that it happens in the xml listener's constructor instead of once per test suite entry. That way, if folks run into the issue, they'll only pay the cost one time instead of n.

This series tries to reuse mt8183-da7219-max98357.c for supporting machine
driver with rt1015 speaker amplifier.

The first 3 patches refactor the code for easier to change for subsequent
patches.

The 4th patch adds document for the new proposed compatible string.

The 5th patch changes the machine driver to support either ""MAX98357A"" or
""RT1015"" codecs.

Tzung-Bi Shih (5):
  ASoC: mediatek: mt8183-da7219: sort header inclusions in alphabetical
  ASoC: mediatek: mt8183-da7219: remove forward declaration of
    headset_init
  ASoC: mediatek: mt8183-da7219: extract codec and DAI names
  ASoC: mediatek: mt8183-da7219: add compatible string for using rt1015

This section was incorrectly removed from Symfony 3, only the `field_name` setting was removed. Disabling/enabling CSRF seperately from the froms is not deprecated and should not be removed.

/cc @symfony/deciders please merge quickly, it's holding up bundles with functional tests wanting to support to Symfony 3

The root cause was that we crawled the tree to mark anyone who depended
on the updated theme dirty _after_ we crawled it to rebuild it. Thus, if
anyone was already marked dirty when the process started, then got
marked clean by the first (rebuild) walk, then got marked dirty again by
the notification, they'd be clean when they got the notification,
despite already being in the dirty list, which would cause an assertion.

Also IconTheme didn't have an operator==, so it was independently too
aggressive about updates.

cost branch ( as defined by the transport cost matrix or the sys pref
StaticHoldsQueueWeight.

Test Plan:
1) Create a record with two items, one for library A and one for library B
2) Set your circulation rules such that the book from library A is
   holdable by all and the book from library B is holdable only by library
   B patrons
3) Create a hold for a Library C patron for pickup at library C
4) Set the syspref StaticHoldsQueueWeight to by Library B, Library A,

5) Rebuild the holds queue
6) Note the hold wasn't picked up even though the item from library A
   could have filled the hold

* Fix: try to improve float literal formatting

An earlier change switched to using the C++ stdlib to format floats, but I neglected to check that it would correctly print values that happen to be integral with a decimal place (e.g., print `1.0` instead of just `1`). That causes some obscure cases to fail (e.g., when you write `1.0.xxxx` in HLSL, and we print out `1.xxxx`).

I've tried to resolve the issue by using the ""fixed"" output format, but that may also create problems for extremely large or small values (which really need to use scientific notation). However, this at least puts us back where we were before...

* Add support for source locations to the IR

- Add a `sourceLocation` field to all `IRValue`s
- Add some logic to associate locations with operations while lowering (using a slightly ""clever"" RAII approach)
- Make sure that when cloning instructions, we also clone the location
- Make the emit logic use the existing support for source locations when emitting code from the IR

A nice cleanup to this work would be to have the source locations for IR values not be hyper-specific about both line and column; it is probably enough to just emit on the correct line.

The PR https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/13121 on 3.0 removed the ``TableHelper `` class. Now the tests don't pass when using ``components=high`` version of dependencis, because of the use of the deprecated TableHelper.

This one removes the use of ``TableHelper`` without the removal of the ``TableHelper`` class, and adapt the existing code to use the Table class instead.

squid-cache/squid,d00e0e6d26acbd4c0c5e7b51f6b2900513282456,"Bug 3826: SMP compatibility with systemd

** These changes require capabilities changes specific to Squid-4 and
   require systemd 209+

NOTE: 'squid -z' command does not yet support SMP with systemd.


Differences from the Squid-3 tools/systemd/squid.service:

- After=nss-lookup.target, for people running a local DNS server like BIND.
  Since there is no requirement dependency, it is a NOP when no such
  service is running.

- Type=forking and squid without -N in ExecStart: SMP now works.

- PIDFile=/var/run/squid.pid to tell systemd what pid is the main one. This
  is actually optional with Squid 4, because systemd will consider its first
  child as the main pid. But let's be safe. DEFAULT_PID_FILE could be used
  here with proper autoconf/automake magic...

- ExecReload calls kill rather than 'squid -k reconfigure'. systemd already
  knows the main pid.

- KillMode=mixed. The old KillMode=process sends SIGTERM (and SIGKILL after
  TimeoutStopSec) only to main daemon process. 'mixed' OTOH sends SIGTERM
  only to main process, but SIGKILL to all services' cgroup processes after
  timeout. With 'mixed' systemd ensures if daemon shutdown fails it will
  clean up all the remains. 'mixed' requires systemd >= 209.

The attached patch causes read_cache_pages() to release page-private data on a
page for which add_to_page_cache() fails.  If the filler function fails, then
the problematic page is left attached to the pagecache (with appropriate flags
set, one presumes) and the remaining to-be-attached pages are invalidated and
discarded.  This permits pages with caching references associated with them to
be cleaned up.

The invalidatepage() address space op is called (indirectly) to do the honours.

nwjs/chromium.src,751fcf391b147439d4637789996f58b37e6e3d37,"android crazy linker: better Globals implementation.

A small cleanup and/or improvement to the way global
data is managed in the crazy linker library:

- Replace ScopedGlobalLock with ScopedLockedGlobals
  which allows reducing the number of Globals::Get()
  call performed at runtime.

- Provide property accessors to the globals that
  don't call Globals::Get() on each call, e.g.

    the static Globals::GetLibraries() is replaced
    by the non-static Globals::libraries() call.

- In crazy_linker_api.cpp, Fix a minor bug where
  the ScopedDelayedCallbackPoster is constructed
  before the global lock is acquired (i.e. a
  thread-race).

  Note that there are still other thread-related
  issues with deferred tasks / callback handling
  but these will be addressed in a future CL.

- Don't use heap allocation for the Globals
  instance storage. This is mostly because there
  were suspicion of invalid pointer addresses
  being passed through callbacks, causing runtime
  crashes (see http://crbug.com/796938 for more
  details). A fixed address in the .bss section
  would be easier to spot in minidump CPU register
  dumps.

For situations where the default network-based discovery is inappropriate
or inconvenient, this allows users to provide a hard-coded discovery
document for a particular hostname in the CLI config.

This is a new config block, rather than combined with the existing
""credentials"" block, because credentials should ideally live in separate
files from other config so that they can be managed more carefully.
However, this new ""host"" block _is_ designed to have room for additional
host-specific configuration _other than_ credentials in future, which
might include TLS certificate overrides or other such things used during
the discovery step.

 2. Adds a list of deprcated tags and their modern replacements to our code

The latter has been the source of many hangs and crashes. It's not
worth the efforts.

When browser process exits, I believe we already shuts down GPU
process atomically.

After this change, the only clean exit for GPU process is the
unsandboxed GPU process that is to collect extra GPU information.
It needs to shut down cleanly to make sure the info collected

Add a DMI quirk for the Point of View TAB-P1006W-232 (v1.0) tablet, this
tablet is special in a number of ways:

1) It uses the 2nd GPIO resource in the ACPI tables for jack-detect rather
then using the rt5651 codec's builtin jack-detect functionality

2) It uses the 3th GPIO resource in the ACPI tables to control the
external amplifier rather then the usual first non GpioInt resource and
the GPIO is active-low.

3) It is a BYTCR device, without a CHAN package and it uses SSP0-AIF1
rather then the default SSP0-AIF2.

4) Its internal mic is a digital mic (the first x86 rt5651 device that
I'm aware of which does this), combined with having its headset-mic
connected to IN2.

1. when calling predict without compiling first.
2. when using a tf.compat.v1.optimizers.Optimizer (these work eagerly & should work in the v2 loops)

This revealed some missing coverage in the tests & a few bugs.

The fixes to these issues are are:
1. Int sample weights used with masks now work correctly (w/o type crashes)
2. Keras in TF2 explicitly disallows using sparse scipy matrices as inputs to dense functional model inputs. A meaningful error is now raised whereas before this crashed w/ unclear messages. In v1 the scipy matrices were silently cast to dense arrays, but this causes ambiguity for subclass models & can't be done w/o too much extra complexity for the data adapters.
3. This cl needs to mark a few tests that depend on v2 dtype behavior as run_v2_only, and changes a few tests to v1_deprecated

apache/spark,f405de87c878c49b17acb2c874be1084465384e9,"[SPARK-14867][BUILD] Remove `--force` option in `build/mvn`

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Currently, `build/mvn` provides a convenient option, `--force`, in order to use the recommended version of maven without changing PATH environment variable. However, there were two problems.

- `dev/lint-java` does not use the newly installed maven.

  ```bash
$ ./build/mvn --force clean
$ ./dev/lint-java
Using `mvn` from path: /usr/local/bin/mvn
```
- It's not easy to type `--force` option always.

If '--force' option is used once, we had better prefer the installed maven recommended by Spark.
This PR makes `build/mvn` check the existence of maven installed by `--force` option first.

According to the comments, this PR aims to the followings:
- Detect the maven version from `pom.xml`.
- Install maven if there is no or old maven.
- Remove `--force` option.

## How was this patch tested?

Manual.

```bash
$ ./build/mvn --force clean
$ ./dev/lint-java
Using `mvn` from path: /Users/dongjoon/spark/build/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin/mvn

kubernetes/release,083826a9d294d7bc26d561d29f5a8f2979ec8b50,"kubepkg: Use maps to retrieve package dependencies

Retrieving dependencies was inconsistent across packages. Some were
retrieved as a string, while other sets were concatenated strings
combining multiple dependencies together.

As rpm specs define dependencies across multiple lines, the current
method would look pretty messy.

Here we create a function, getDependencies(), which takes a
*packageDefinition as input and builds a map of dependencies, with their
requisite versions as the map values.

From there we index the map values within the package templates.

colinsc/koha,255b9b98d01f330b2d6cc48fa3efa2ed599a50c7,"Bug 23843: Add mapping to Koha::Patron

This patch adds a to_api_mapping method to the class. This in effect
enables calling ->to_api on the object. The mapping is borrowed from the
API controller. It is not removed from the controller so we are able to
verify (through the tests) that there is no behavior change.
Once this is pushed we need to implement the counter-wise methods and
clean the controllers.
To test:
1. Run:
   $ kshell
  k$ prove t/db_dependent/api/v1/patrons.t
=> SUCCESS: Tests pass
2. Apply this patch
3. Repeat (1)

Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

WebVTT objects are now subclasses of the Element. This allows us to remove major WebVTT chunks of code from
Element.h and NodeRareData. WebVTTElement is deriving from HTMLElement and not Element to prevent possible
problems that could happen because we reuse qTags that are being used in HTML like <b>, <i> and <u>.

No new tests. This is just a refactoring of the existing code.

YAML version of marc21 mandatory marc21_framework_DEFAULT.

To test:
1) Do a clean install with mandatory data,
   dump table marc_tag_structure and
   marc_subfield_structure, reserve.

2) Apply this patch and it's dependencies

3) Do a clean install, dump again and compare
   No major differences expected

4) Try translation
  a) Go to misc/translator
  b) create files for a new language
     ./translate create xx-YY
  c) Check new file po/xx-YY-instaler-MARC21.po
     Verify strings from this file.
  d) Install new language
     ./translate install xx-YY
  e) Try clean install with new files

NOTE: This patch fails with qa tools!
Reason is that qa tools use YAML.pm module to
check files, but Installer.pm or LangInstaller.pm
are using YAML::Syck, using that module gives
no error, check for example:

perl -e 'use YAML::Syck qw( LoadFile ); $y = LoadFile(""marc21_framework_DEFAULT.yml"");'
No error!

tprrt/linux-stable,19ccb76a1938ab364a412253daec64613acbf3df,"KVM: PPC: Implement H_CEDE hcall for book3s_hv in real-mode code

With a KVM guest operating in SMT4 mode (i.e. 4 hardware threads per
core), whenever a CPU goes idle, we have to pull all the other
hardware threads in the core out of the guest, because the H_CEDE
hcall is handled in the kernel.  This is inefficient.

This adds code to book3s_hv_rmhandlers.S to handle the H_CEDE hcall
in real mode.  When a guest vcpu does an H_CEDE hcall, we now only
exit to the kernel if all the other vcpus in the same core are also
idle.  Otherwise we mark this vcpu as napping, save state that could
be lost in nap mode (mainly GPRs and FPRs), and execute the nap
instruction.  When the thread wakes up, because of a decrementer or
external interrupt, we come back in at kvm_start_guest (from the
system reset interrupt vector), find the `napping' flag set in the
paca, and go to the resume path.

This has some other ramifications.  First, when starting a core, we
now start all the threads, both those that are immediately runnable and
those that are idle.  This is so that we don't have to pull all the
threads out of the guest when an idle thread gets a decrementer interrupt
and wants to start running.  In fact the idle threads will all start
with the H_CEDE hcall returning; being idle they will just do another
H_CEDE immediately and go to nap mode.

This required some changes to kvmppc_run_core() and kvmppc_run_vcpu().
These functions have been restructured to make them simpler and clearer.
We introduce a level of indirection in the wait queue that gets woken
when external and decrementer interrupts get generated for a vcpu, so
that we can have the 4 vcpus in a vcore using the same wait queue.
We need this because the 4 vcpus are being handled by one thread.

Secondly, when we need to exit from the guest to the kernel, we now
have to generate an IPI for any napping threads, because an HDEC
interrupt doesn't wake up a napping thread.

Thirdly, we now need to be able to handle virtual external interrupts
and decrementer interrupts becoming pending while a thread is napping,
and deliver those interrupts to the guest when the thread wakes.
This is done in kvmppc_cede_reentry, just before fast_guest_return.

Finally, since we are not using the generic kvm_vcpu_block for book3s_hv,
and hence not calling kvm_arch_vcpu_runnable, we can remove the #ifdef
from kvm_arch_vcpu_runnable.

Thomas Schlichter reported:
> X.org uses libpciaccess which tries to mmap with write combining enabled via
> /sys/bus/pci/devices/*/resource0_wc. Currently, when PAT is not enabled, the

> ;-(

Instead of silently mapping pci mmap region as UC minus in the case
of !pat_enabled and wc request, we can return error. Eric Anholt mentioned
that caller (like X) typically follows up with UC minus pci mmap request and
if there is a free mtrr slot, caller will manage adding WC mtrr.

Jesse Barnes says:
> Older versions of libpciaccess will behave better if we do it that way
> (iirc it only allocates an MTRR if the resource_wc file doesn't exist or

The class is just a static-only container, and should really be rewritten as
either top-level getters instead of static getters, or as instance getters
on an interface (in case we ever want to mock it).

Also, the isOSName getters for each individual supported OS doesn't scale.
We should consider removing them and only support the `operatingSystem` getter.

tprrt/linux-stable,55f14da66954083b621debbdbf62c7fc429291e8,"Merge branch 'iff_no_queue_fixups'

Phil Sutter says:

====================
fixup IFF_NO_QUEUE conversion

This series serves two purposes:

On one hand it fixes a quite embarrassing bug around the warning I added for
drivers still setting tx_queue_len = 0 to achieve noqueue operation. It turned
out to be quite useless as due to using alloc_netdev(), many in-kernel drivers
fell into the trap by accident, as well. Instead this place serves pretty well
as a sanitizing point to set IFF_NO_QUEUE for drivers not initializing
tx_queue_len, which in turn allows to drop all special treatment of the latter
being zero since that can not happen anymore without IFF_NO_QUEUE being set.

On the other hand, it provides a better solution for Eric Dumazet's concern
regarding how to assign noqueue to an interface which does not default to it
already. In order to make this possible, noqueue is being registered so users
can 'tc qd add dev eth0 root noqueue'. In addition, it resolves the ugly
situation of 'tc qd show' not showing noqueue. Finally, the former changes
allow for some code cleanup.

When hitting an internal error, we'd attempt to render the diff viewer
page with the error information. This ended up breaking though, since
later in the page, the JavaScript block would try to access context
variables that didn't exist, causing an entirely different error to
display.

We no longer execute that section of the block when showing an error,
allowing the error information to show through.

I've also cleaned up the presentation just a bit so that it's not
completely meaningless, and so that we don't show the traceback unless
it's being viewed by a superuser. This will help prevent some leakage of
information here, while allowing admins to get the details.

Testing Done:
Triggered an error and viewed the page as an admin, as as a normal user.
Saw the two versions of the page. I no longer got the Django traceback
about the context variables.

tprrt/linux-stable,35d3fdd5f304c06654c940921fc045c60df34693,"rtc-cmos: improve HPET IRQ glue

Resolve http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11051 and other bugs
related to the way the HPET glue code in rtc-cmos was incomplete and
inconsistent:

 * Switch the approach so that the basic driver code flow isn't
   changed by having HPET ... instead, just have HPET shadow the
   RTC_CONTROL irq enables and RTC_FREQ_SELECT data.  It's only
   coping with IRQ thievery, after all.

 * Do that consistently (!!) to avoid problems when the HPET code
   is out of sync with the real RTC intent.  Examples include:

   - cmos_procfs(), which now reports correct data

   - cmos_irq_set_state() ... also removing the previous PIE_{ON,OFF}
     ioctl support so only one code path manages ""periodic"" IRQs

   - cmos_do_shutdown() ... currently a ""just in case"" change.

   - cmos_suspend() and cmos_resume() ... also handling a bug that
     was specific to HPET's IRQ thievery, where the alarm wasn't
     disabled after waking the system

 * Always call that HPET code under the RTC spinlock (it doesn't do
   its own locking)

Also clean up the HPET glue:

 * Add some comments explaining what's going on.

 * Switch to having just one #ifdef for the HPET glue, and inline
   functions (not #defines) to avoid some compiler warnings.

 * Have the probe message also report when HPET IRQs are involved

This still leaves various holes in the HPET glue, like the emulated update
IRQs being out of sync with the RTC, alarms never using day or month
matches, and many extra IRQs (at 64 Hz).

* chore: add fpzip library to ext/

* feat: first pass at creating a cython wrapper for fpzip

* broken: compiling and kinda running, but buffer overflows

* uncommenting decompress. can't decode stream is writes

* cleaned up setup.py

* feat: fpzip decompress is confirmed working

* feat: fpzip compress and decompress

* fix: handle empty array

* feat: chunks.py supports kempression, compression.py has fpzip

kempression is Nico Kemnitz's suggestion to put XY data close
together and ensure all floats between 0 and 1 have the same
exponent. This allows fpzip to work at higher efficiency
with a loss of at most 1 machine float32 epsilon.

* test: try to fix travis

* fix: failed fpzip imports give the correct error message

* chore: drop python 2.6 support

* fix: don't support python2

Also:
- add help messages to fpzip.pyx
- change cloudvolume.fpzip to fpzip (python2 was having trouble with it)

* fix: cloudvolume can read/write fpzip but something is weird with it

* feat: add ""green"" text command to lib.py

* fix: encode bytes sent to fpzip in fortran order

* fix: remove annoying fpzip error message unless actually using it

Introduce in the Comment Management lists both a quick fade out transition for disappearing comments and an undoable global notice in response to actions.

## Changes

- Add `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` to handle a fade out transition on component unmount.
Please note that `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` is deprecated as of React 15.0, and its replacement is tracked in https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/13321.

- Add global notices in response to actions performed on comments.
  - All notices (except ""Delete Permanently"") feature an Undo button, that simply fires the `setCommentStatus` method with the previous comment status.
  - Undos don't trigger any notice, and are therefore not undoable directly in the notice (they can of course be undone by via comment action).
  - The notices are not stacked together, but performing multiple actions on the same comment (e.g. `approve -> unapprove -> approve -> etc.`) only displays one single notice containing the last performed action.
In other words, we display one notice top for each actioned comment.
  - The notices are set to last 5 seconds before automatically disappearing.
  - The notices are persistent on route changes.
This is to prevent them to disappear when changing Comment Management list.
The side effect, though, is that undoing a notice while outside the Comment Management would trigger the `setCommentStatus` method of the `CommentList` component, which is not mounted anymore.",,,,,,12_may_2021_mp_not_refactor_commits
libvirt/libvirt,912421e7b63a358d552b79fac62a5518ec58f4e5,"domain_capabilities: Assert enums fit into unsigned int bitmask

The way our domain capabilities work currently, is that we have
virDomainCapsEnum struct which contains 'unsigned int values'
member which serves as a bitmask. More complicated structs are
composed from this struct, giving us whole virDomainCaps
eventually.

Whenever we want to report that a certain value is supported, the
'1 << value' bit is set in the corresponding unsigned int member.
This works as long as the resulting value after bitshift does not
overflow unsigned int. There is a check inside
virDomainCapsEnumSet() which ensures exactly this, but no caller
really checks whether virDomainCapsEnumSet() succeeded. Also,
checking at runtime is a bit too late.

Fortunately, we know the largest value we want to store in each
member, because each enum of ours ends with _LAST member.
Therefore, we can check at build time whether an overflow can
occur.

* feat: Record predicate check results into kernels.status_data
* fix: Impl. of sql_json_merge() and update comments
* refactor: clarify sql_json_increment() API
* fix: Add session_creation_id, just like kernel's creation_id
  - It needs to be kept in the kernels table to go through the scheduler framework.
    So this commit requires `alembic upgrade` to add a column for this.
* fix: Resource tracking with multi-node sessions
  - Previously the resource usage was increased by only one kernel's requested resource slots,
    instead of the sum of all kernel's requested resource slots.
  - Split txns in the multi-node scheduling routine instead of manually committing whenever
    raising an exception as part of the expected control flow.
  - Remove clusterized condition check assuming that all agents belong to the Docker Swarm.
  - Remove most of failure callbacks of predicates because now predicate results are
    stored to the status_data column in a structured way, instead of appending parenthesized
    message to the status_info column.
* setup: Update aiopg to the latest release (15 days ago), v1.1.0, which fixes
  transaction release bugs when ""async with"" block is interrupted/cancelled upon its
  entering, leaving connections in an active transaction and thus accumulation of them
  causing connection pool exhaustion.
* fix: Remove no longer used agents.clusterized column
* It is now replaced with explicit agent error stored to the kernels.status_data column.
* fix: A critical db-connection mis-reuse bug (NEEDS BACKPORT)
  - It was fortunately mostly working, but this may cause ""only one cursor
    allowed for one connection"" errors at random times.
* fix: Use separate DB connections for agents and kernels in scheduler
  - This allows us to record the kernel's status info about scheduling failures
    and rollback the agent's occupied_slots fields upon scheduling failures.
  - Fix a deadlock due to simultaneous use of the row-level lock and the
    repeatable-read transaction.
* fix: Multi-node scheduling
  - Update the candidate_agent list whenever we apply kernel.requested_slots to
    a specific agent, so that the next scheduling decision could be made on top of
    existing scheduling decisions of kernels, within a multi-node multi-container session.
* JSONB null is not SQL NULL in postgres.
  - When setting status_data to None, aiopg.sa translates it into a JSONB null,
    which causes invalid jsonb concatenation error afterwards when other queries
    try to use sql_json_merge() expression involving SQL COALESCE() function.
* fix: Relax another row-level lock since we use the ""REPEATABLE READ"" isolation level
  throughout the agent DB connection's transaction.
* fix: Multi-node scheduling
  - Do not promote sub-kernels to the PREPARING state unless
    all sub-kernels get a proper agent binding.
  - Fill the missing multi-node-aware implementation of
    _list_pending_sessions() and _list_existing_sessions()
  - Proceed to the next scaling group (if any) when we see
    scheduling failures in a scaling group, instead of bubbling
    up those failures. (NEEDS BACKPORT)",,,,,,12_may_2021_mp_not_refactor_commits

dslutz/qemu,00a29f3ddcd506f2fdba4d115e6c8df676f203db,"target-arm: Don't expose wildcard ID register definitions for ARMv8

In ARMv8 the 32 bit coprocessor ID register space is tidied up to
remove the wildcarded aliases of the MIDR and the RAZ behaviour
for the unassigned space where crm = 3..7. Make sure we don't
expose thes wildcards for v8 cores. This means we need to have
a specific implementation for REVIDR, an IMPDEF register which
may be the same as the MIDR (and which we always implement as such).

Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
Post-install message from i18n:

HEADS UP! i18n 1.1 changed fallbacks to exclude default locale.
But that may break your application.

If you are upgrading your Rails application from an older version of Rails:

Please check your Rails app for 'config.i18n.fallbacks = true'.
If you're using I18n (>= 1.1.0) and Rails (< 5.2.2), this should be
'config.i18n.fallbacks = [I18n.default_locale]'.
If not, fallbacks will be broken in your app by I18n 1.1.x.

If you are starting a NEW Rails application, you can ignore this notice.

ChangeSet@1.2782, 2008-02-05 16:23:57+01:00, vvaintroub@wva. +5 -0
  Preparation for DBUG_PRINT cleanup
  - implement formatted output for pointer, size_t and longlong in
    my_vsnprint
  - use my_vsnprint in DBUG_PRINT (_db_doprnt)
  - change fopen() not to use ""a+c"" or ""w+c"" on Windows, but ""a+"" or ""w""
  as on other platforms. Syncing to disk after each write is not really
  needed and slows down tracing considerably.

  dbug/dbug.c@1.40, 2008-02-05 16:23:54+01:00, vvaintroub@wva. +4 -9
    -Use my_vsnprintf for formatted output in _db_doprnt ,
    as my_vsnprintf now has possibility to output pointers, longlongs and
    size_t's in uniform C99-compatible fashion on every platform
    - Windows : fopen() trace file with ""a+"" or ""w"",
    instead of ""a+c"" or ""w+c"".  The later caused FlushFileBuffer() after each
    write, which significantly slowed down  the trace.

`reduceByWindow` for Java API is actually not Java compatible, change to make it Java compatible.

Current solution is to deprecate the old one and add a new API, but since old API actually is not correct, so is keeping the old one meaningful? just to keep the binary compatible? Also even adding new API still need to add to Mima exclusion, I'm not sure to change the API, or deprecate the old API and add a new one, which is the best solution?

reviewboard/reviewboard,6fdfc5c9a7bf56a03e16c346887389d93d48d1e1,"Added a `rbext create` command for creating new extensions.

This introduces a new `rbext` subcommand, `rbext create`, which
generates a working extension source tree, complete with packaging,
based on the provided arguments. It's used to quickly get up and
running with extension development, and replaces the old, outdated
`contrib/tools/generate_extension.py`.

At its simplest, this just needs a human-displayable name for an
extension, and will generate a suitable package and class name from
those, and a working package and extension as well. This can be
customized with specific extension class and package names, author
information, and options for setting up static media and configuration
support. This can be expanded later for additional options, if we
choose.

There are a few major differences from the old `generate_extension.py`.
First, anyone with the `ReviewBoard` package installed can generate an
extension without needing to check out a source tree, making this much
more accessible to developers. It doesn't require an undocumented
dependency on `jinja2`, and instead generates all content inline within
the code (which does result in more lengthy code but helps keep all the
generation templates viewable at once). It also outputs more
future-proof extension code, unlike the old code which made use of
several deprecated Django conventions.

Documentation was added on `rbext`, including the existing `rbext test`,
and the main Extending Review Board page has a tip link that points to
`rbext create`.

Testing Done:
Used this to build a few test extensions, with/without static media
and configuration. Review Board saw the extensions and let me enable
them. It also let me edit the configuration for an extension with
configuration available.

Manually inspected all the generated code.

I've found a bug while using the 'entity' FormType.

Doctrine allow the definition of primary keys which are foreign key of other entities. In this scenario, the `EntityChoiceList` instance check if:
  * the entity has a id composed by a single column and
  * eventually, the column is an integer

When this happens, it use the primary key as ""choices indices"", but since is an entity it fails in many places, where it expects integer.

The easy solution is to check whether the single-column id is not an association. Anyway, I've fixed it the RightWay™ :), and now it resolve the entity reference to the actual column type, and restart the logic. Code speaks better then words.

Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
Post-install message from i18n:

HEADS UP! i18n 1.1 changed fallbacks to exclude default locale.
But that may break your application.

If you are upgrading your Rails application from an older version of Rails:

Please check your Rails app for 'config.i18n.fallbacks = true'.
If you're using I18n (>= 1.1.0) and Rails (< 5.2.2), this should be
'config.i18n.fallbacks = [I18n.default_locale]'.
If not, fallbacks will be broken in your app by I18n 1.1.x.

If you are starting a NEW Rails application, you can ignore this notice.

nwjs/chromium.src,a0287cbdc1a56a27bf0eb29671942e44c8da599e,"Redo fix from yesterday.

Post Mortem on why yesterday's fix was bogus:

The motivation for this change was because a separate CL had a OneShotTimer<> as
part of a Singleton class.  The Singleton is cleaned up in the AtExit manager,
which currently runs after the MessageLoop is destroyed.  The following
sequence left a dangling pointer:

   1) Start a OneShotTimer
          - Creates a task and registers on the MessageLoop
   2) Destroy MessageLoop   (this deletes all Pending Tasks)
   3) Destroy your OneShotTimer
          - Tries to reference a dangling pointer for the already-deleted task.

The fix was to modify the Task such that at destruction it would zero-out the
wrapper's pointer to the Task.  Now step 3 would not reference a bogus pointer.

Unfortunately, the fix is broken.  The timers work by having a wrapper Timer
class (BaseTimer_Helper) and a Task.  The Task has a pointer back to its wrapper
and the wrapper has a pointer to the task.   For the case where a timer is
re-started from within its Run() loop, things fail:

    1) Start a RepeatingTimer
    2) Timer fires via the MessageLoop
            MessageLoop calls Run()
    3) Run() restarts the timer, which creates a new Task but reuses the
       same BaseTimer_Helper.
             BaseTimer_Helper's timer pointer now points to the NEW timer
    4) The MessageLoop destroys the Task
             The new code zeroes out the task pointer in the
             BaseTimer_Helper, breaking the newly restarted timer.



This fix is the same as yesterday's fix, except:
  1) More comments
  2) Added extra check at line 169.  Don't reset the Task pointer when 
     destroying the Task if the Timer does not point to the Task being
     destroyed.

I'm confident, but not 100% positive that this fixes the problem.  I did
reproduce *something* using PageHeap which now seems to be gone, but I
can't quite confirm.

The Passenger Standalone runtime installer has now been split into multiple

This patch fixes a user-triggerable oops that was reported by Leonid
Ananiev as archived at http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/8/337.

dio writes invalidate clean pages that intersect the written region so that
subsequent buffered reads go to disk to read the new data.  If this fails
the interface tries to tell the caller that the cache is inconsistent by
returning EIO.

Before this patch we had the problem where this invalidation failure would
clobber -EIOCBQUEUED as it made its way from fs/direct-io.c to fs/aio.c.
Both fs/aio.c and bio completion call aio_complete() and we reference freed
memory, usually oopsing.

This patch addresses this problem by invalidating before the write so that
we can cleanly return -EIO before ->direct_IO() has had a chance to return
-EIOCBQUEUED.

There is a compromise here.  During the dio write we can fault in mmap()ed
pages which intersect the written range with get_user_pages() if the user
provided them for the source buffer.  This is a crazy thing to do, but we
can make it mostly work in most cases by trying the invalidation again.
The compromise is that we won't return an error if this second invalidation
fails if it's an AIO write and we have -EIOCBQUEUED.

This was tested by having two processes race performing large O_DIRECT and
buffered ordered writes.  Within minutes ext3 would see a race between
ext3_releasepage() and jbd holding a reference on ordered data buffers and
would cause invalidation to fail, panicing the box.  The test can be found
in the 'aio_dio_bugs' test group in test.kernel.org/autotest.  After this
patch the test passes.

Currently the `deprecated` message is using `warn`, meaning that it's possible to disable warnings about deprecated API usage through the `PDFJS.verbosity` setting.

I don't think that it should be possible to opt out of deprecation messages,[1] since it might mean that in a custom deployment of PDF.js these messages could be overlooked, leading to PDF.js being broken (seemingly without any warning) when updating to a future version.
Obviously this could be considered the responsibility of the people doing custom PDF.js implementations, but in order to reduce the support burden later on, it seems better to ""annoy"" people upfront.

Compared to various `info`/`warn`/`error` messages, `deprecated` messages should be very simple to get rid of -- just update the API usage and the message goes away!

Details:

* The detection of invalid test validation values (i.e. 'test' setting in
  test case) in CLITestsBase.command_test() did not detect invalid values at
  all (its assert statement checked the assertion message). Fixed that, and
  added the test case description to the exception that is raised.

* The corrected detection in turn surfaced a number of invalid test
  validation values. Fixed all of them. In some cases, this required
  also fixing the expected results.

* In test_instance_cmd.py, removed two duplicate tests for 'instance count'.

* In test_instance_cmd.py, changed some tests for 'instance count' to test
  validation 'linesnows' instead of 'innows', which is a stronger test.

Minor test cleanup:

* In test_instance_cmd.py, moved the CMD_OPTION_HELP_HELP_LINE always to the
  end of the list of *_HELP_LINES, and made sure it has a trailing comma.

* In test_connection_cmds.py, removed use of MOCK_CONFIRMY_FILE because
  the two test cases that specified it did not prompt at all (they probably
  did prompt at some point in the past).

* In test_connection_cmds.py, renamed variable MOCK_PROMPT0_FILE to
  MOCK_PROMPT_0_FILE, for consistency.

* Removed some double spaces in test case deacriptions.

* Removed double empty lines between test case items.

tprrt/linux-stable,2ebff7bbd785c86e12956388b9e6f6bb8ea5d21e,"xfs: flush entire last page of old EOF on truncate up

On a sub-page sized filesystem, truncating a mapped region down
leaves us in a world of hurt. We truncate the pagecache, zeroing the
newly unused tail, then punch blocks out from under the page. If we
then truncate the file back up immediately, we expose that unmapped
hole to a dirty page mapped into the user application, and that's
where it all goes wrong.

In truncating the page cache, we avoid unmapping the tail page of
the cache because it still contains valid data. The problem is that
it also contains a hole after the truncate, but nobody told the mm
subsystem that. Therefore, if the page is dirty before the truncate,
we'll never get a .page_mkwrite callout after we extend the file and
the application writes data into the hole on the page.  Hence when
we come to writing that region of the page, it has no blocks and no
delayed allocation reservation and hence we toss the data away.

This patch adds code to the truncate up case to solve it, by
ensuring the partial page at the old EOF is always cleaned after we
do any zeroing and move the EOF upwards. We can't actually serialise
the page writeback and truncate against page faults (yes, that
problem AGAIN) so this is really just a best effort and assumes it
is extremely unlikely that someone is concurrently writing to the
page at the EOF while extending the file.

The save_return_regs and restore_return_regs macros are only used by
return_to_handler, and having them defined out-of-line only serves to
obscure the logic.

Before we complicate, let's clean this up and fold the logic directly
into return_to_handler, saving a few lines of macro boilerplate in the
process. At the same time, a missing trailing space is added to the
comments, fixing a code style violation.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.

This will show a leases.tdb record leak. If you SIGSTOP the smbtorture
process while it's in the 10-second wait, you will find locking.tdb

there will be an entry in leases.tdb left.

I have no clue how to test this properly, or how to have a reasonably
cheap assert in smbd during normal operations. The problem is that
this leak can't really be distinguished from a ""normal"" leak that a
crashed smbd would leave behind. Possibly we need a background job
walking leases.tdb to clean this up properly.

nwjs/chromium.src,601f2ef11b664dfb8bffd8982de9d8afa560a8cc,"Fix cc unit tests that depend on verify_property_trees=true

A number of cc unit tests have started checking property tree output,
primarily visible_rect_from_property_trees but also needs_rebuild on the
trees.

Because of this, these tests now depend on running the property tree
code, so setting verify_property_trees=false forces these tests to run
only CDP code which causes them to fail.

Therefore, convert these specific tests to use property tree updates
directly.  This also requires a PrecalculateMetaInformation function
for LayerImpl, as LayerTreeHostCommonTest.SkippingSubtreeImpl touched
LayerImpl properties that could only theoretically be changed from
the main thread.

In the future, I think all layer tree host common tests will need to go
down the property tree update path, but (in my opinion) it's not worth
doing that until we have property trees everywhere.  This patch is just
a step in that direction to unblock property trees for the compositor
thread first.

We have the `elf-dynamic-tags-machine-specific.yaml` input shared
between the llvm-readobj and llvm-objdump test.
It looks strange, because tools usually does not share inputs.

Also there are following problems related:
1) `elf-dynamic-tags-machine-specific.yaml` input contains excessive YAML parts.
2) objdump's test case never test AARCH64 tags.
3) There are unknown tags in the `elf-dynamic-tags-machine-specific.yaml` and
    `dynamic-tags-machine-specific.test`, though we already testing unknown tags
    in `\llvm-readobj\ELF\dynamic-tags.test` and `llvm-objdump\elf-dynamic-section.test` tests.

This patch removes the shared input and refines the test cases to resolve
issues mentioned.

alphagov/paas-cf,247c5c99a041751b7de6fa1ca38feaa0c0cd8ea3,"Refactor bosh manifest from spiff to spruce

Merging in spruce is done a little differently.  From the docs:

  Files to merge are listed in-order on the command line. The first file
  serves as the base to the file structure, and subsequent files are
  merged on top, adding when keys are new, replacing when keys exist. This
  differs slightly in mentality from spiff, but hopefully the results are
  more predictable.

This means that it's not necessary to list hash keys at the top-level in
order for them to appear in the output.

We also remove '(( merge || <literal> ))' operations

Due to the way spruce merges these, these can be literal values, spruce
will automatically overwrite them if a subsequent file includes a value.

Without this patch, this test was accidentally testing that
CLANG_RESOURCE_DIR, CLANG_LIBDIR_SUFFIX, and CLANG_VERSION_STRING

a regular expression that covered ""all"" possible combinations of

By excluding the tests like this, they will also be disabled

be a problem since we have a TSan v2 bot running too (which uses

This commit adds 2 universe decorators:
  GetSubscriptionRequestsUniverseDecorator
    Allows functional substitution of the GetSubscriptionRequests impl
  SelectSymbolsUniverseDecorator:
    Allows functional substituion of the SelectSymbols impl

This allows us to compose universes that can modify symbol selection and
subscription request behaviors which is all that's needed to chain
universes together.

For example, consider the case with coarse fundamental and fine fundamental.
  We'll configure coarse to return fine subscription requests and configure
  fine to prefilter its data to only allow those that were also selected by
  coarse.

tprrt/linux-stable,aac2f1bf14d07c8f13048915f39df4a527350c9a,"ixgbe: limit combined total of macvlan and SR-IOV VFs

Hardware has a limited number of pools available (64). Previously, no
checks were in place to limit the number of accelerated macvlan devices
based on the number of pools. Normally this would be ok, because there
was already a limit for these well below the number of available pools.
However, SR-IOV uses the very same pools. Therefor, we need to ensure
that the total number of pools (number of VFs plus the number of non-VF
pools in use for accelerated macvlans) does not exceed the number of
pools available in hardware.

This patch resolves a kernel NULL pointer dereference caused by the following commands:

$modprobe ixgbe max_vfs=63

$ethtool -K eth2 l2-fwd-offload on

$ip link add link eth2 macvlan0 type macvlan

$ip link set dev macvlan0 up

Most importantly, this allows instrumenting these calls with extra
tracing information when debugging without having to rebuild the world
(thread_restrictions.h is implicitly included virtually everywhere).

that's orthogonal to this CL)

lerna/lerna,cc9b48725f89ad94a2fa2b5cd7f984da199cd5a1,"Fix logifyAsync, logifySync decorators. (#372)

The decorator spec requires that a function decorator either:

- returns a new /descriptor/ for the property, or
- changes the fields on the given descriptor

The logify* methods instead returned a new function implementation, which
is not correct, and caused the decorations to be silently ignored.

decorator spec: https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators#detailed-design
function decorator example: https://github.com/jayphelps/core-decorators.js/blob/master/src/deprecate.js

This commit changes logifySync and logifyAsync in the following ways:

- they now have no return value, and instead modify the descriptor
- they now must be called with no arguments so they can properly capture
  the `this` value (without this, the function cannot find the logger instance)
- they now log at 'verbose', because they are extremely verbose
- remove 'error' flag from non-error logging
- they truncate their serialized arguments to (arbitrarily) 100 characters because
  otherwise they they OOM the node process

Additionally, one async method was erroneously decorated with logifySync.",,,,,,12_may_2021_mp_not_refactor_commits

CTSRD-CHERI/u-boot,8beed3d7ac5a3253a850bdadcb2dbc1fec6aff6c,"binman: Adjust pylibfdt for incremental build

If the pylibfdt shared-object file is detected, then Python assumes that
the libfdt.py file exists also.

Sometimes when an incremental build aborts, the shared-object file is
built but the libfdt.py is not. The only way out at this point is to use
'make mkproper', or similar.

Fix this by removing the .so file before it is built. This seems to make
Python rebuild everything.

The code to fetch the version of an operation catches any
Exception. The only actual exception that can occur is a
null-pointer exception of credentials.getOne returns null.
Let's just make the code null-safe and remove all catch and
warning logic.

One of the main motivations of this is that ProviderVersion is
no longer even relevant now that the Kubernetes V1 provider has
been removed from the code. Logging a warning related to being
unable to fetch the provider version just confuses debugging;
if the account doesn't exist, that itself is the problem, so
we should note that in the warning, rather than that we couldn't
fetch the version.

This limits the amount of damage a pathological program can cause in
thrashing the LRU cache.

I ran the script described here:
https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/1327#issuecomment-374003960

Without this patch, the entire output would get drawn in one frame that
took about 140 ms to draw. With this patch, it takes about 60 ms. It's
still nowhere as good as the static or none atlas implementations, but
it's not terrible, like it was.

This should have minimal impact on real-world applications: it'll just
take a little longer for the atlas to warm up.

The implementation is a little hacky, since it involves throwing some
code into TextRenderLayer that violates the separation of concerns, but
we can clean this up later.

We've seen cases where Cast discovery code fails to pick up services
from the ServiceDiscoveryDeviceLister, whereas chrome://inspect
(CastDeviceProvider) is able to do so. Since Cast discovery's

this suggests it has gone into a bad state after a prolonged period.
Compared to the CastDeviceProvider's ServiceDiscoveryDeviceLister,
which gets created/destroyed when the inspect page is loaded/unloaded.

To mitigate this issue, this patch uses the ForceDiscovery() signal to
recreate a new ServiceDiscoveryDeviceLister in DnsSdDeviceLister
and kick off the discovery using the new object, and to clear the set
of services in the cache. This puts DnsSdDeviceLister in a clean state
which will the current set of services to get through to the Cast

apache/spark,5e79ae3b40b76e3473288830ab958fc4834dcb33,"[SPARK-23961][SPARK-27548][PYTHON] Fix error when toLocalIterator goes out of scope and properly raise errors from worker

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This fixes an error when a PySpark local iterator, for both RDD and DataFrames, goes out of scope and the connection is closed before fully consuming the iterator. The error occurs on the JVM in the serving thread, when Python closes the local socket while the JVM is writing to it. This usually happens when there is enough data to fill the socket read buffer, causing the write call to block.

Additionally, this fixes a problem when an error occurs in the Python worker and the collect job is cancelled with an exception. Previously, the Python driver was never notified of the error so the user could get a partial result (iteration until the error) and the application will continue. With this change, an error in the worker is sent to the Python iterator and is then raised.

The change here introduces a protocol for PySpark local iterators that work as follows:

1) The local socket connection is made when the iterator is created
2) When iterating, Python first sends a request for partition data as a non-zero integer
3) While the JVM local iterator over partitions has next, it triggers a job to collect the next partition
4) The JVM sends a nonzero response to indicate it has the next partition to send
5) The next partition is sent to Python and read by the PySpark deserializer
6) After sending the entire partition, an `END_OF_DATA_SECTION` is sent to Python which stops the deserializer and allows to make another request
7) When the JVM gets a request from Python but has already consumed it's local iterator, it will send a zero response to Python and both will close the socket cleanly
8) If an error occurs in the worker, a negative response is sent to Python followed by the error message. Python will then raise a RuntimeError with the message, stopping iteration.
9) When the PySpark local iterator is garbage-collected, it will read any remaining data from the current partition (this is data that has already been collected) and send a request of zero to tell the JVM to stop collection jobs and close the connection.

Steps 1, 3, 5, 6 are the same as before. Step 8 was completely missing before because errors in the worker were never communicated back to Python. The other steps add synchronization to allow for a clean closing of the socket, with a small trade-off in performance for each partition. This is mainly because the JVM does not start collecting partition data until it receives a request to do so, where before it would eagerly write all data until the socket receive buffer is full.

## How was this patch tested?

Added new unit tests for DataFrame and RDD `toLocalIterator` and tested not fully consuming the iterator. Manual tests with Python 2.7  and 3.6.

Closes #24070 from BryanCutler/pyspark-toLocalIterator-clean-stop-SPARK-23961.

google/llvm-propeller,7415205113f8c473dc2f84a7cd72700d84fe2459,"Teach instcombine to canonicalize ""element extraction"" from a load of an
integer and ""element insertion"" into a store of an integer into actual
element extraction, element insertion, and vector loads and stores.

Previously various parts of LLVM (including instcombine itself) would
introduce integer loads and stores into the code as a way of opaquely
loading and storing ""bits"". In some cases (such as a memcpy of
std::complex<float> object) we will eventually end up using those bits
in non-integer types. In order for SROA to effectively promote the
allocas involved, it splits these ""store a bag of bits"" integer loads
and stores up into the constituent parts. However, for non-alloca loads
and tsores which remain, it uses integer math to recombine the values
into a large integer to load or store.

All of this would be ""fine"", except that it forces LLVM to go through
integer math to combine and split up values. While this makes perfect
sense for integers (and in fact is critical for bitfields to end up
lowering efficiently) it is *terrible* for non-integer types, especially
floating point types. We have a much more canonical way of representing
the act of concatenating the bits of two SSA values in LLVM: a vector
and insertelement. This patch teaching InstCombine to use this
representation.

With this patch applied, LLVM will no longer introduce integer math into
the critical path of every loop over std::complex<float> operations such
as those that make up the hot path of ... oh, most HPC code, Eigen, and
any other heavy linear algebra library.

For the record, I looked *extensively* at fixing this in other parts of
the compiler, but it just doesn't work:
- We really do want to canonicalize memcpy and other bit-motion to
  integer loads and stores. SSA values are tremendously more powerful
  than ""copy"" intrinsics. Not doing this regresses massive amounts of
  LLVM's scalar optimizer.
- We really do need to split up integer loads and stores of this form in
  SROA or every memcpy of a trivially copyable struct will prevent SSA
  formation of the members of that struct. It essentially turns off
  SROA.
- The closest alternative is to actually split the loads and stores when
  partitioning with SROA, but this has all of the downsides historically
  discussed of splitting up loads and stores -- the wide-store
  information is fundamentally lost. We would also see performance
  regressions for bitfield-heavy code and other places where the
  integers aren't really intended to be split without seemingly
  arbitrary logic to treat integers totally differently.

[Form] trigger deprecation warning when using empty_value

The `empty_value` option is deprecated in the `choice`, `date`, and
`time` form types. Therefore, a deprecation warning must be triggered
when the users configures a value for this option.

The `datetime` form type does not need to be updated as it passes
configured values to the `date` and `time` form types which trigger
deprecation warnings anyway.

### What is this PR for?
Fixing ZEPPELIN-2382:

A fresh install of Zeppelin 0.7.1 failed to start on a Windows due to the use of [getPosixFilePermissions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#getPosixFilePermissions(java.nio.file.Path,%20java.nio.file.LinkOption...))

This method fails on Windows with an UnsupportedOperationException - however, recovering (that is ignoring the exception) appears to have no negative effects. (For a discussion on this related to a different project see, e.g., https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-intellij/issues/937 )

### What type of PR is it?
[Bug Fix]

### Todos
* [x] - Have the binary distribution checked by the reporter of [ZEPPELIN-2382]

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2382

### How should this be tested?
Check if clean distribution runs on Windows. Important: Ensure that HADOOP_HOME points to a folder containing bin/winutils.exe since this pull request does not include a fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2438 (which is part of a separate pull request).

### Screenshots (if appropriate)

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update?
No

* Is there breaking changes for older versions?
No

* Does this needs documentation?
No

mostly around postMessage API usage for embedded MimeHandlerView which would
determine the use cases for cross vs. same origin resources.

Expected Outcome:
  * Determine the popularity of the API; and in specific, the type of messages.
  * Determine the usage of the API for cross-origin resources. This would help
    decide the path forward for CORB vs. embedded PDF.
  * Frequency of postMessage to embedded PDF.

If the usages are small UKMs might help track down the users of the API and possibly deprecate the

tprrt/linux-stable,be78ff0e72778eb4df4aac66edb9e97462bfe00d,"xfs: recheck reflink / dirty page status before freeing CoW reservations

Eryu Guan reported seeing occasional hangs when running generic/269 with
a new fsstress that supports clonerange/deduperange.  The cause of this
hang is an infinite loop when we convert the CoW fork extents from
unwritten to real just prior to writing the pages out; the infinite
loop happens because there's nothing in the CoW fork to convert, and so
it spins forever.

The fundamental issue here is that when we go to perform these CoW fork
conversions, we're supposed to have an extent waiting for us, but the
low space CoW reaper has snuck in and blown them away!  There are four
conditions that can dissuade the reaper from touching our file -- no
reflink iflag; dirty page cache; writeback in progress; or directio in
progress.  We check the four conditions prior to taking the locks, but
we neglect to recheck them once we have the locks, which is how we end
up whacking the writeback that's in progress.

Therefore, refactor the four checks into a helper function and call it
once again once we have the locks to make sure we really want to reap
the inode.  While we're at it, add an ASSERT for this weird condition so
that we'll fail noisily if we ever screw this up again.

Since Linux v3.2, vsyscalls have been deprecated and slow.  From v3.2
on, Linux had three vsyscall modes: ""native"", ""emulate"", and ""none"".

""emulate"" is the default.  All known user programs work correctly in
emulate mode, but vsyscalls turn into page faults and are emulated.
This is very slow.  In ""native"" mode, the vsyscall page is easily
usable as an exploit gadget, but vsyscalls are a bit faster -- they
turn into normal syscalls.  (This is in contrast to vDSO functions,
which can be much faster than syscalls.)  In ""none"" mode, there are
no vsyscalls.

For all practical purposes, ""native"" was really just a chicken bit
in case something went wrong with the emulation.  It's been over six
years, and nothing has gone wrong.  Delete it.

2. Deferred combine pass to swapchain color & depth

4. Forward pass
5. UI

World position is no longer a component of the GBuffer, it will be determined from depth (which is now being passed into deferred combine) Currently using a stub in the shader.

readable.

The right pane on the Requests tab now displays the local
time the selected request was started at the top of each log
page.  The time, in milliseconds, of each event relative
to the source's first event is displayed in a new ""[st=#]""
column.

In the Data tab, after pressing dump to text, request
entries also display the information mentioned above.
Also, the local time is displayed in human readable format
for each ""Host resolver cache"" entry.

Note that just updating the two modified files may not result
in the pak file they're merged into being rebuilt. On Linux,
touching chrome/browser/resources/net_internals/index.html
seems to do the trick.  On Windows, just forcing
chrome_extra_resources to be rebuilt manually works as well.
